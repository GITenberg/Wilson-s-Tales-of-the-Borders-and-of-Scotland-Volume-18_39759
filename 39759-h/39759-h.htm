<h2>WILSON'S</h2>

<h3>AND OF SCOTLAND.</h3>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THOMAS OF CHARTRES.</h2>


<p>One morning, early in the spring of 1298, a small Scottish
vessel lay becalmed in the middle of the Irish Channel,
about fifteen leagues to the south of the Isle of Man.
During the whole of the previous night, she had been borne
steadily southward, by a light breeze from off the fast receding
island; but it had sunk as the sun rose, and she
was now heaving slowly to the swell, which still continued
to roll onward, in long glassy ridges from the north. A
thick fog had risen as the wind fell&mdash;one of those low sea
fogs which, leaving the central heavens comparatively clear,
hangs its dense, impervious volumes around the horizon;
and the little vessel lay as if imprisoned within a circular
wall of darkness, while the sun, reddened by the haze,
looked down cheerily upon her from above. She was a
small and very rude-looking vessel, furnished with two lug-sails
of dark brown, much in the manner of a modern
Dutch lugger; with a poop and forecastle singularly high,
compared with her height in the waist; and with sides
which, attaining their full breadth scarcely a foot over the
water, sloped abruptly inwards, towards the deck, like the
wall of a mole or pier. The parapet-like bulwarks of both
poop and forecastle were cut into deep embrasures, and
ran, like those of a tower, all around the areas they enclosed,
looking down nearly as loftily on the midships as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
on the water. The sides were black as pitch could render
them&mdash;the sails scarcely less dark; but, as if to shew
man's love of the ornamental in even the rudest stage of
art, a huge misshapen lion flared in vermillion on the
prow, and over the stern hung the blue flag of Scotland,
with the silver cross of St Andrew stretching from corner
to corner.</p>

<p>From eight to ten seamen lounged about the decks.
They were uncouth-looking men, heavily attired in jerkins
and caps of blue woollen, with long, thick beards, and
strongly-marked features. The master, a man considerably
advanced in life&mdash;for, though his eye seemed as bright as
ever, his hair and beard had become white as snow&mdash;was
rather better dressed. He wore above his jerkin a short
cloak of blue which confessed, in its finer texture, the
superiority of the looms of Flanders over those of his own
country; and a slender cord of silver ran round a cap of
the same material. His nether garments, however, were
coarse and rude as those of his seamen; and the shoes he
wore were fashioned, like theirs, of the undressed skin of
the deer, with the hair still attached; giving to the foot
that brush-like appearance which had acquired to his countrymen
of the age, from their more polished neighbours,
the appellation of rough-footed Scots. Neither the number,
nor the appearance of the crew, singular and wild as
the latter was, gave the vessel aught of a warlike aspect;
and yet there were appearances that might have led one to
doubt whether she was quite so unprepared for attack or
defence as at the first view might be premised. There ran
round the butt of each mast a rack filled with spears, of
more knightly appearance than could have belonged to a
few rude seamen&mdash;for of some of these the handles were
chased with silver, and to some there were strips of pennon
attached; and a rich crimson cloak, with several pieces of
mail, were spread out to the morning sun, on one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
shrouds.</p>

<p>The crew, we have said, were lounging about the deck,
unemployed in the calm, when a strong, iron-studded door
opened in the poop, and a young and very handsome man
stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Has my unfortunate cloak escaped stain?" he said to
the master. "Your sea-water is no brightener of colour."</p>

<p>"It will not yet much ashame you, Clelland," said the
master, "even amid the gallants of France; but, were it
worse, there is little fear, with these eyes of yours, of being
overlooked by the ladies."</p>

<p>"Nay, now, Brichan, that's but a light compliment from
so grave a man as you," said Clelland. "You forget how
small a chance I shall have beside my cousin."</p>

<p>"Not jealous of the Governor, Clelland, I hope?" said
the old man, gaily. "Nay, trust me, you are in little
danger. Sir William is perhaps quite as handsome a man
as you, and taller by the head and shoulders; but, trust me,
no one will ever think of him as a pretty fellow. He stands
too much alone for that. Has he risen yet?"</p>

<p>"Risen!&mdash;he has been with the chaplain for I know not
how long. Their Latin broke in upon my dreams two hours
ago. But what have we yonder, on the edge of that bank
of fog! Is it one of the mermaidens you were telling me
of yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said the master, "it is but a poor seal, risen to
take the air. But what have we beyond it? By heavens
I see the dim outline of a large vessel, through the fog!
and yonder, not half a bow-shot beyond, there is another!
Saints forbid that it be not the English fleet, or the ships
of Thomas of Chartres! Clelland, good Clelland, do call
up the Governor and his company!"</p>

<p>Clelland stepped up to the door in the poop, and shouted
hastily to his companions within&mdash;"Strange sails in
sight!&mdash;supposed enemies&mdash;it were well to don your armours."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
And then turning to a seaman. "Assist me, good fellow,"
he said, "in bracing on mine."</p>

<p>"Thomas of Chartres, to a certainty!" exclaimed the
master&mdash;"and not a breath to bear us away! Would to
heavens that I were dead and buried, or had never been
born!"</p>

<p>"Why all this ado, Brichan?" said Clelland, who, assisted
by the sailor, was coolly buckling on his mail. "It was
never your wont before, to be thus annoyed by danger."</p>

<p>"It is not for myself I fear, noble Clelland," said the
master, "if the Governor were but away and safe. But,
oh, to think that the pride and stay of Scotland should fall
into the merciless hands of a pirate dog! Would that my
own life, and the lives of all my crew, could but purchase
his safety!"</p>

<p>"Take heart, old man," said Clelland, with dignity.
"Heaven watches over the fortunes of the Governor of
Scotland; nor will it suffer him to fall obscurely by the
hands of a mere plunderer of merchants and seamen.&mdash;Rax
me my long spear."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the Governor himself stepped forward from
the door in the poop, enveloped from head to foot in complete
armour. He was a man of more than kingly presence&mdash;taller,
by nearly a foot, than even the tallest man
on deck, and broader across the shoulders by full six inches;
but so admirably was his frame moulded, that, though his
stature rose to the gigantic, no one could think of him as a
giant. His visor was up, and exhibited a set of high
handsome features, and two of the finest blue eyes that
ever served as indexes to the feelings of a human soul.
His chin and upper lip were thickly covered with hair of
that golden colour so often sung by the elder poets; and
a few curling locks of rather darker shade escaped from
under his helmet. A man of middle stature and grave
saturnine aspect, who wore a monk's frock over a coat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
mail, came up behind him.</p>

<p>"What is to befall us now, cousin Clelland?" said the
Governor. "Does not the truce extend over the channel,
think you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, these are not English enemies, noble sir," replied
the master. "We have fallen on the fleet of the infamous
Thomas of Chartres."</p>

<p>"And who is Thomas of Chartres?" asked the Governor.</p>

<p>"A cruel and bloodthirsty pirate&mdash;the terror of these
seas for the last sixteen years. Wo is me!&mdash;we have
neither force enough to fight, nor wind to bear us away!"</p>

<p>"Two large vessels," said the Governor, stepping up to
the side, "full of armed men, too; but we muster fifty,
besides the sailors; and, if they attempt boarding us, it
must be by boat. Is it not so, master? The calm which
fixes us here, must prevent them from laying alongside and
overmastering us."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, noble sir," said the master; "but we see only
a part of the fleet."</p>

<p>"Were there ten fleets," exclaimed Clelland, impatiently,
"I have met with as great odds ashore&mdash;and here comes
Crawford."</p>

<p>The door in the poop was again thrown open, and from
forty to fifty warriors, in complete armour, headed by a tall
and powerful-looking man, came crowding out, and then
thronged around the masts, to disengage their spears. They
were all robust and hardy-looking men&mdash;the flower apparently
of a country side; and the coolness and promptitude
with which they ranged themselves round their leader,
to wait his commands, shewed that it was not now for the
first time they had been called on to prepare for battle.
They were, in truth, tried veterans of the long and bloody
struggle which their country had maintained with Edward&mdash;men
who, ere they had united under a leader worthy to
command them, had resisted the enemy individually, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
preserved, amid their woods and fastnesses, at least their
personal independence. Such a party of such men, however
great the odds opposed to them, could not, in any circumstances,
be deemed other than formidable.</p>

<p>"We are not born for peace, countryman," said the
Governor&mdash;"war follows us even here. Meanwhile, lie
down, that the enemy mark not our numbers. That foremost
vessel is lowering her boat, and yonder tall man in
scarlet, who takes his seat in the bows, seems to be a leader."</p>

<p>"It is Thomas of Chartres, himself," said the master.
"I know him well. Some five-and-twenty years ago, we
sailed together from Palestine."</p>

<p>"And what," asked the Governor, "could have brought
a false pirate there?"</p>

<p>"He was no false pirate then," replied the master, "but
a true Christian knight; and bravely did he fight for the
sepulchre. But, on his return to France, where he had
been pledged to meet with his lady-love, he fell under the
displeasure of the King, his master; and, ever since, he has
been a wanderer and a pirate. You will see, as he approaches,
the scallop in his basnet; and be sure he will be
the first man to board us."</p>

<p>"Excellent," exclaimed the Governor, gaily; "we shall
hold him hostage for the good behaviour of his fleet. Mark
me, cousin Crawford. His barge shoves off, and the men
bend to their oars. He will be here in a twinkling. Do
you stand by our good Ancient&mdash;would there were but
wind enough to unfurl it!&mdash;and the instant he bids us
strike, why, lower it to the deck; but be as sure you hoist
it again when you see him fairly aboard. And you, dear
Clelland, do you take your stand here on the deck beside
me, and see to it, when I am dealing with the pirate, that
you keep your long spear between us and his crew. It
will be strange if he boast of his victory this bout."</p>

<p>The men, at the command of their leader, had prostrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
themselves on the deck, while his two brethren in arms,
Crawford and Clelland, stationed themselves at his bidding&mdash;the
one on the vessel's poop, directly under the pennon,
the other at his side in the midships. The pirate's barge,
glittering to the sun with arms and armour, and crowded
with men, rowed lustily towards them; but, while yet a
full hundred yards away, a sudden breeze from the west
began to murmur through the shrouds, and the bellying
sails swelled slowly over the side.</p>

<p>"Heaven's mercy be praised!" exclaimed the master,
"we shall escape them yet. Lay her easy to the wind,
good Crawford&mdash;lay her easy to the wind, and we shall
bear out through them all."</p>

<p>"Nay, cousin, nay," said the Governor, his eyes flashing
with eagerness, "the pirate must not escape us so. Lay
the vessel to. Turn her head full to the wind. And you,
captain, draw off your men to the hold. We must not lose
our good sailors; and these woollens of yours will scarcely
turn a French arrow. Nay, 'tis I who am master now"&mdash;for
the old man seemed disposed to linger. "I may
resign my charge, perhaps, by and by; but you must obey
me now."</p>

<p>The master and his sailors left the deck. The barge of
the pirate came sweeping onward till within two spears'
length of the vessel, and then hailed her with no courtly
summons of surrender. "Strike, dogs, strike! or you shall
fare the worse!" It was the pirate himself who spoke,
and Crawford, at his bidding, pulled down the Ancient.
The barge dashed alongside. Thomas of Chartres, a very
tall and very powerful man, seized hold of the bulwark
rail with one hand, and bearing a naked sword in the
other, leaped fearlessly aboard, within half a yard of where
the Governor stood, half-concealed by the shrouds and the
bulwarks. In a moment the sword was struck down, and
the intruder locked in the tremendous grasp of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
champion of his time. Crawford hoisted the Ancient, yard-high,
to the new-risen breeze; while Clelland struck his
long spear against the pirate who had leaped on the gunwale
to follow his leader, with such hearty good-will that
the steel passed through targe and corselet, and he fell back
a dead man into the boat. In an instant the concealed
party had sprung from the deck, and fifty Scottish spears
bristled over the gunwale, interposing their impenetrable
hedge between the pirate crew and their leader. For a
moment, the latter had striven to move his antagonist; but,
powerful and sinewy as he was, he might as well have
attempted to uproot an oak of an hundred summers.
While yet every muscle was strained in the exertion, the
Governor swung him from off his feet, suspended him at
arm's length for full half a moment in the air, and then
dashed him violently against the deck. A stream of blood
gushed from mouth and nostril, and he lay stunned and
senseless where he fell. Meanwhile, the crew of the barge,
taken by surprise, and outnumbered, shoved off a boat's
length beyond reach of the spears, and then rested on their
oars.</p>

<p>"He revives," said the warrior in the monk's frock,
going up to the fallen pirate. "Reiver though he be, he
has fought for the holy sepulchre, and has worn golden
spurs."</p>

<p>"I will deal with him right knightly," said the Governor.
"Yield thee, Sir Thomas of Chartres," he continued, bending
over the prisoner, and holding up a dagger to his face&mdash;"yield
thee true hostage for the good conduct of thy
fleet&mdash;or shall I call the confessor?"</p>

<p>"I yield me true hostage," said the fallen man. "But
who art thou, terrible warrior, that o'ermasterest De Longoville
of France as if he were a stripling of twelve summers?
Art Wallace, the Scottish Champion!"</p>

<p>"Thou yieldest, De Longoville," said the Governor, "to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Sir William Wallace of Elderslie. But how is it that I
meet, in the infamous Thomas of Chartres, that true soldier
of the Cross, De Longoville? I have heard minstrels sing
of thy deeds against the Saracen, Sir Knight, while I was
yet a boy; and yet here art thou now, the dread of the
wandering sailor and the merchant&mdash;a chief among thieves
and pirates."</p>

<p>"Alas! noble Wallace, thou sayest too truly," said Sir
Thomas; "but yet wouldst thou deem me as worthy of
pity as of censure, didst thou but know all, and the remorse
I even now endure. For a full year have I determined
to quit this wild, unknightly mode of life, and go a pilgrim
as of old; not to fight for the sepulchre&mdash;for the battles of
the Cross are over&mdash;not to fight, but to die for it. But I
accept, noble champion, this my first defeat on sea, as a
message from heaven. Accept of me as true soldier under
thee, and I will fight for thee in thy country's quarrel, to
the death."</p>

<p>"Most willingly, brave De Longoville," said the Governor,
as he raised him from the deck; "Scotland needs
sorely the use of such swords as thine."</p>

<p>"And deem not her cause less holy," said the monk&mdash;for
monk he was, the well-known Chaplain Blair&mdash;"deem
not her cause less holy than that of the sepulchre itself;
nor think that thou shalt eradicate the stain of past dishonour
less surely in her battles. The cause of justice,
De Longoville, is the cause of God, contend for it where
we may."</p>

<p>Wallace returned to De Longoville the sword of which
he had so lately disarmed him; and the pirate admiral,
on learning that the champion was bound for Rochelle,
issued orders to his fleet, which, now that the mist rose,
was found to consist of six large vessels, to follow close
in their wake. The breeze blew steadily from the north-west,
and the ships went careering along, each in her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
long furrow of white, towards the port of their destination;
the pirate vessels keeping aloof full two bowshots from the
Scotsman&mdash;for so De Longoville had ordered, to prevent
suspicion of treachery. He had set aside his armour,
and now appeared to his new associates as a man of noble
and knightly bearing, tall and stalwart as any warrior
aboard, save the Governor; and, though his hair was
blanched around his temples, and indicated the approach of
age, the light step and quick sparkling eye gave evidence
that his vigour of frame still remained undiminished. He
sat apart, with the Governor and his two kinsmen, Clelland
and Crawford, in the cabin under the poop. It was a rude,
unornamented apartment, as might be expected, from the
general appearance of the vessel; but the profusion of
arms and pieces of armour which hung from the sides,
glittering to the light that found entrance through a casement
in the deck, bestowed on the place an air of higher
pretension. A table with food and wine was placed before
the warriors.</p>

<p>"It is now twenty-six years, or thereby," said De Longoville,
"since I quitted Palestine for France, with the good
Louis. I had fought by his side on the disastrous field of
Massouna, and did all that a man of mould might to rescue
him from the Saracens, when he fell into their hands,
exhausted by his wounds and his sore sickness. But that
day was written a day of defeat and disaster to the soldiers
of the Cross. Nor need I say how I took my stand, with
the best of my countrymen, on the walls of Damietta, and
maintained them for the good cause, despite of the assembled
forces of the Moslem, until we had bought back our
king from captivity, by yielding up the city we defended
for his ransom. It is enough for a disgraced man and a
captive to say that my services were not overlooked by those
whose notice was most an honour; and that, ere I embarked
for France, I received the badge of knighthood from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
hand of the good Louis himself.</p>

<p>"You all know of how different a character Charles of
Anjou was from his brother the king. I had returned from
the crusade rich, only in honour, and found the lady of my
affections under close thrall by her parents, who had resolved
that she should marry Loithaire, Lord of Languedoc.
I knew that her heart was all my own; but I knew, besides,
that I must become wealthy ere I could hope to compete
for her with a rival such as Loithaire; and the good Pope
Nicholas having made over the crown of the Two Sicilies to
Charles of Anjou, in an evil hour I entered the army with
which Charles was to wrest it from the bastard Manfred&mdash;having
certain assurance, from the tyrant himself, that, if
he succeeded, I should become one of the nobles of Sicily.
We encountered Manfred at Beneventura, and the bastard
was defeated and slain. But I must blush, as a knight, for
the honour of knighthood&mdash;as a Frenchman, for the fair fame
of my country&mdash;when I think of the cruelties which followed.
Not the worst tyrants of old Rome could have surpassed
Charles of Anjou in his butcheries. The blood
plashed under the hoofs of his charger as he passed through
the cities of his future kingdom; and, when he had borne
down all opposition, 'twould seem as if, in his eagerness
to destroy all who might resist, he had also determined
to extirpate all who could obey. But his policy proved as
unsound as 'twas cruel and unjust, as the terrible <i>Eve of the
Vespers</i> has since shown. The Princes of Germany, headed
by the chivalrous Conradine of Swabia, united against us in
the cause of the people. But the arms of France were
again triumphant; the confederacy was broken, and the gallant
Conradine fell into the hands of Charles. It was I,
warriors of Scotland! to whom he surrendered; and I had
granted him, as became a knight, an assurance of knightly
protection. But would that my arms had been hewn off at
the shoulders when I first beat down his sword, and intercepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his retreat! The infamous Charles treated my
knightly assurance with scorn; and&mdash;can you credit such
baseness, noble Wallace!&mdash;he ordered Conradine of Swabia&mdash;a
true knight, and an independent prince&mdash;for instant
execution, as if he were a common malefactor. My blood
boils, even now, when I recall that terrible scene of injustice
and cruelty. The soldiers of France crowded round the
scaffold; and I was among them, burning with shame and
rage. Ere Conradine bent him to the executioner, he took
off his glove, and throwing it amongst us, adjured us, if we
were not all as dead to honour as our leader, to bear it to
some of his kinsmen, who would receive it as a pledge of
investiture in his rights, and as beqeathing the obligation
to revenge his death. Will you blame me, noble Wallace!
that, Frenchman as I was, I seized the glove of Conradine,
and fled the army of Charles; and that, ere I returned to
France, I delivered it up to Pedro of Arragon, the near
kinsman of the last Prince of Swabia?</p>

<p>"My king and friend, the good Louis, had sailed from
France for Palestine, on his last hapless voyage, ere I had
executed my mission. On my return to France, however,
I found a galley of Toulon on the eve of quitting port, to
join with his fleet, then on the coast of Africa, and, snatching
a hurried interview with the lady of my affections,
maugre the vigilance of her relatives, I embarked to fight
under Louis, as of old, for the blessed sepulchre. We
landed near Tunis, and saw the tents of France glittering
to the sun. But all was silent as midnight, and the royal
standard hung reversed over the pavilion of the good Louis.
He had died that morning of the plague; and his base and
cruel brother, the false Charles of Anjou, sat beside the
corpse. I felt that I had fallen among my enemies; for
though the young King was there, he was weak and inexperienced,
and open to the influence of his uncle. The first
knight I met, as I entered the camp, was Loithaire of Languedoc&mdash;now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the wily friend and counsellor of Charles.
There were lying witnesses suborned against me, who accused
me of the most incredible and unheard-of practices;
and of these Loithaire was the chief. 'Twas in vain I demanded
the combat, as a test of my innocence. The combat
was denied me; my sword was broken before the assembled
chivalry of France; my shield reversed; and sentence
was passed that I should be burnt at a stake, and my
ashes scattered to the four winds of heaven. But it was
not written that I should perish so. Scarce an hour before
the opening of the day appointed for my execution, I broke
from prison, assisted by a brother soldier, whose life I had
saved in Palestine, and escaped to France.</p>

<p>"I was a broken and ruined man. But how wondrous
the force of true affection! My Agnes knew this; and yet,
knowing all, she contrived to elude her guardians, and fled
with me to the sea-shore, where we embarked, in a ship of
Normandy, for the south of Ireland. From that hour De
Longoville has fought under no banner but his own. I
renounced, in my anger, my allegiance to my country-nay,
declared war with the sovereign who had so injured me.
The years passed, and desperate and dishonoured men like
myself came flocking to me as their leader, till not Philip
himself, or my old enemy Charles, had more kingly
authority on land than De Longoville on the sea. But let
no man again deceive himself as I have done. I had reasoned
on the lax morality and doubtful honour of kings,
and asked myself why I might not, as the admiral and prince
of my fleet, achieve a less guilty, though not less splendid
glory than the bastard William of Normandy, or Edward of
England, or my old enemy Charles of Anjou. But I have
long since been taught that what were high achievements
and honourable conquest in the admiral of a hundred vessels,
is but sheer piracy in the captain of six. I can trust, however,
that the last days of De Longoville may yet be deemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
equal to the first; and that the middle term of his life may
be forgiven him for its beginning and its close. Not a
month since, I carried my wife and daughter to France,
and took final leave of them, with the purpose of setting
out on my pilgrimage to Palestine. That intention, noble
Wallace! is now altered; and I must again seek them out,
that they may accompany me to Scotland."</p>

<p>"The foul stain of treason, brave Longoville, must be removed,"
said the Governor. "Charles of Anjou has long
since gone to his account: does the Lord of Languedoc still
survive!"</p>

<p>"He still lives," replied the admiral; "his years do not
outnumber my own."</p>

<p>"Then must he either retract the vile calumny, or grant
you the combat. The young Philip has pledged his knightly
word, when he solicited the visit I am now voyaging to pay
him, that he would grant me the first boon I craved in person,
should it involve the alienation of his fairest province.
That boon, brave De Longoville, will, at least, present you
with the means of regaining your fair fame."</p>

<p>De Longoville knelt on the cabin floor, and kissed the
hand of the Governor. The conversation glided imperceptibly
to other and lighter matters; time passed gaily in the recital
of stories of chivalrous endurance or exploit; and the gale,
which still blew steadily from the north-west, promised a
speedy accomplishment of their voyage. For four days
they sailed without shifting back or lowering sail; and, on
the morning of the fifth, cast anchor in the harbour of
Rochelle.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day after their arrival, a
single knight was pricking his steed through one of the
glades of the immense forest which, at this period, covered
the greater part of the province of Poitiers. He had been
passing, ever since morning, through what seemed an interminable
wilderness of wood&mdash;here clustered into almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
impenetrable thickets shagged with an undergrowth of
thorn, there opening into long bosky glades and avenues
that seemed, however, only to lead into recesses still more
solitary and remote than those that darkened around him.
During the early part of the day, the sun had looked down
gaily among the trees, checkering the sward below with a
carpeting of alternate light and shadow; and the knight,
a lover of falconry and the chase, had rode jocundly on
through the peopled solitude; ever and anon grasping his
spear, with the eager spirit of the huntsman, as the fawn
started up beside his courser, and shot like a meteor across
the avenue, or the wild boar or wolf rustled in the neighbouring
brake. Towards evening, however, the eternal
sameness of the landscape had begun to fatigue him; the
sun, too, had disappeared, long before his setting, in a veil
of impenetrable vapour, mottled with grey, ponderous
clouds, betokening an approaching storm; and the horseman
pressed eagerly onward, in the hope of reaching, ere
its bursting, the hostelry in which he had purposed to pass
the evening. He had either, however, mistaken his way or
miscalculated his distance; for after passing dell and
dingle, glade and thicket, in monotonous succession, for
hours on hours, the forest still seemed as dense and unending,
and the hostelry as distant as ever. A brown and
sleepy horror seemed to settle over the trees as the evening
darkened; the thunder began to bellow in long peals, far to
the south, and a few heavy drops to patter from time to
time on the leaves, giving indication of the approaching
deluge. The knight had just resigned himself to
encounter all the horrors of the storm, when, on descending
into a little bosky hollow, through which there
passed a minute streamlet, he found himself in front
of a deserted hermitage. It was a cell, opening, like an
Egyptian tomb, in the face of a low precipice. A rude
stone-cross, tapestried with ivy, rose immediately over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
narrow door-way.</p>

<p>"The saints be praised!" exclaimed the knight, leaping
lightly from his horse. "I shall e'en avail myself of the
good shelter they have provided. But thou, poor Biscay,"
he continued, patting his steed, "wouldst that thou wert
with thy master, mine host of the Three <i>Fleurs de Lis!</i>&mdash;there
is scant stabling for thee here. This way, however,
good Biscay&mdash;this way. Thou must bide the storm as thou
best may'st in yonder hollow of the rock." And, leading
the animal to the hollow, he fastened him to the stem of a
huge ivy, and then entered the hermitage.</p>

<p>It consisted of one small rude apartment, hewn, apparently
with immense labour, in the living rock. A seat
and bed of stone occupied the opposite sides; and in the
extreme end, fronting the door, there was a rude image of
the Virgin, with a small altar of mouldering stone, placed
before it. The evening was oppressively sultry, and, taking
his seat on the bedside, the knight unlaced and set aside
his helmet, exhibiting to the fast-dying light, the brown
curling hair and handsome features of our old acquaintance
Clelland&mdash;for it was no other than he. The thunder
began to roll in louder and longer peals, and the lightning
to illumine, at brief intervals, every glade and dingle without,
and every minute object within; when a loud scream
of dismay and terror, blent with the infuriated howl of
some wild animal, rose from the upper part of the dell, and
Clelland had but snatched up his spear and leaped out into
the storm, when a young female, closely pursued by an
enormous wolf, came rushing down the declivity, in the
direction of the hermitage; but, in crossing the little stream,
overcome apparently by fatigue and terror, she stumbled
and fell. To interpose his person between the poor girl
and her ravenous pursuer was with Clelland the work of
one moment; to make such prompt and efficient use of his
spear that the steel head passed through and through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
monster, and then buried itself in the earth beneath, was
his employment in the next. The black blood came spouting
out along the shaft, crimsoning both his hands to the
wrists; and the transfixed savage, writhing itself round on
the wood in its mortal agony, and gnashing its immense
fangs, just uttered one tremendous howl that could be
heard even above the pealing of the thunder, and then
belched out his life at his feet. He raised the fallen girl,
who seemed for a moment to have sunk into a state of
partial swoon, and, disengaging his good weapon from
the bleeding carcass, he supported her to the hermitage in
the rock.</p>

<p>She was attired in the garb of a common peasant of the
age and country; but there was even yet light enough to
shew that her beauty was of a more dignified expression
than is almost ever to be found in a cottage&mdash;exquisite in
colour and form as that which we meet with in the latter,
may often be. There was a subdued elegance, too, in her
few brief, but earnest expressions of gratitude to her deliverer,
that consorted equally ill with her attire. On
entering the hermitage, she knelt before the altar, and
prayed in silence; while Clelland took his seat on the stone
couch where he had before placed his helmet, leaving to
his new companion the settle on the opposite side. Meanwhile
the storm without had increased tenfold. The thunder
rolled overhead, peal after peal, without break or pause;
so that the outbursting of every fresh clap was mingled
with the echoes in which the wide-spread forest had replied
to the last. At times, the opposite acclivity, with
all its thickets, seemed as if enveloped in an atmosphere
of fire&mdash;at times one immense seam of forked lightning
came ploughing the pitchy gloom of the heavens, from
the centre to the horizon. The wild beasts of the forest
were abroad. Clelland could hear their fierce howlings
mingled with the terrific bellowings of the heavens. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
dead sultry calm was suddenly broken. A hurricane went
raging through the woods. There was a creaking, crackling,
rushing sound among the trees, as they strained and
quivered to the blast; and a roaring, like that of some huge
cataract, showed that a waterspout had burst in the upper
part of the dell, and that the little stream was coming down
in thunder&mdash;a wide and impetuous torrent. Clelland's
fair companion still remained kneeling before the altar.
'Twould seem as her prayer of thanks for her great deliverance
had changed into an earnest and oft-reiterated petition
for still further protection.</p>

<p>In a pause of the storm, the frightful howlings of a flock
of wolves were heard rising from over the hermitage, as if
hundreds had assembled on its roof of rock. Clelland
sprung from his seat, and, grasping his spear, stood in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"We shall have to bide siege," he said to his companion.
"I knew not that these fierce creatures mustered so thickly
here."</p>

<p>"Heaven be our protection!" said the maiden. "They
fill every recess of the forest. I had left my mother's this
evening for but an instant&mdash;'twas in quest of a tame fawn&mdash;when
the monster from whose murderous fangs you
delivered me, started up between me and my home; and I
had to fly from instant destruction into the thick of the
forest."</p>

<p>"And so your place of residence is quite at hand?" said
Clelland. "In the course of a long day's journey, I have
not met with a single human habitation."</p>

<p>"The hermitage," replied the maiden, "is but a short
half-mile from my mother's&mdash;would that we were but safe
there!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, the howling of the wolves burst out again,
in frightful chorus, from above, and at least a score of the
ravenous animals came leaping down over the rock, brushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in their descent the ivy and the underwood. Clelland
couched his spear, so that nothing could enter by the narrow
doorway without encountering its sharp point. But
the wolves came not to the attack; and their yells and
howlings from the hollow of the rock, blent with the terrified
snortings and pawings of poor Biscay, shewed that
they were bent on an easier conquest, and bulkier, though
less noble prey. The animal, in his first struggle, broke
loose from his fastenings, and went galloping madly past;
and an intensely bright flash of lightning, that illumined
the whole scene of terror without, shewed him in the act
of straining up the opposite bank, with a huge wolf fastened
to his lacerated back, and closely pursued by full
twenty more.</p>

<p>It was, in truth, a night of dread and terror. Towards
morning, however, the storm gradually sunk into a calm
as dead as that which had preceded it, and a clear, starry
sky looked down on the again silent forest. The maiden,
now that there was less of danger, was rendered thoroughly
unhappy by thoughts of her mother. She had left her, she said,
but for an instant&mdash;left her solitary in her dwelling;
and how must she have passed so terrible a night! Clelland
strove to quiet her fears. There was a little cloud in the
east, he said, already reddening on its lower edge; in an
hour longer, it would be broad day, and he could then conduct
her to her mother's.</p>

<p>"You have not always worn such a dress as that which
you now wear," he continued; "nor have you spent all your
days on the edge of the forest. Does your father still live?"</p>

<p>There was a pause for a moment.</p>

<p>"I am a native of France," she at length said; "but I
have passed most of my time in other countries. My
father, in fulfilment of a vow, is now bound on a pilgrimage
to Palestine."</p>

<p>"And may I not crave your name?" asked Clelland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"My name," she replied, "is Bertha de Longoville.
Brave and courtly warrior, but for whose generous and
knightly daring I would have found yester-evening a
horrid tomb in the ravenous maw of the wolf, do not, I
pray you, ask me more. A vow binds me to secrecy for
the time."</p>

<p>"Nay, fear not, gentle maiden," said Clelland, "that
what you but wish to keep secret, I shall once urge you to
reveal. But hear me, lady, and then judge how far I am
to be trusted. You are the only daughter of Sir Thomas
de Longoville, once a true soldier of the blessed Cross, but,
in his latter days, less fortunate in his quarrels. Your
father is now in France, and in two weeks hence will be
in Paris."</p>

<p>"Saints and angels!" exclaimed the maiden, "he has
fallen into the hands of his enemies!"</p>

<p>"Not so, lady; he is among his best friends. The
knightly word of Sir William Wallace of Elderslie, who
never broke faith with friend or enemy, is pledged for his
safe-keeping. With my kinsman, he is secure of at least
safety&mdash;perhaps even of grace and pardon. But the day
has broken, maiden; suffer me to conduct you to your
mother's."</p>

<p>They left the hermitage together, and ascended the side of
the dell. As they passed the hollow in the rock, a bright
patch of blood caught the eye of Clelland.</p>

<p>"Ah, poor Biscay!" he exclaimed; "there is all that
now remains of him; and how to procure another steed in
this wild district, I know not. My kinsman will be at
Paris long ere his herald gets there. Well, there have
been greater mishaps. Yonder is the carcass of the wolf
I slew yester-evening, half eaten by his savage companions."</p>

<p>The morning, we have said, was calm and still; but the
storm of the preceding night had left behind it no doubtful
vestiges of its fury. The stream had fallen to its old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
level, and went tinkling along its channel, with a murmur
that only served to shew how complete was the silence; but
the banks were torn and hollowed by the recent torrent,
and tangled wreaths of brushwood and foliage lay high on
the sides of the dell. The broken and ragged appearance
of the forest gave evidence of the force of the hurricane.
The fallen trees lay thick on the sides of the more exposed
acclivities&mdash;some reclining like spears, half bent to the
charge, athwart the spreading boughs of such of their neighbours
as the storm had spared; others lay as if levelled by
the woodman, save that their long flexile roots had thrown
up vast fragments of turf, resembling the broken ruins of
cottages. And, in an opening of the wood, a gigantic oak,
the slow growth of centuries, lay scattered over the soil, in
raw and splintery fragments, that gave strange evidence
of the irresistible force of the agent employed in its destruction.
The trees opened as they advanced, and they
emerged from the forest as the first beams of the sun had
begun to glitter on the topmost boughs. A low, moory
plain, walled in by a range of distant hills, and mottled
with a few patches of corn, and a few miserable cottages,
lay before them. A grey detached tower, somewhat resembling
that of an English village church, rose on the
forest edge, scarce a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>"Yonder tower, Sir Knight," said the maiden, "is the
dwelling of my mother. Alas! what must she not have
endured during the protracted horrors of the night!"</p>

<p>"There is, at least, joy waiting her now," said Clelland;
"and all will soon be well."</p>

<p>They approached the tower. It was a small and very
picturesque erection, of three low stories in height, with
projecting turrets at the front corners, connected by a hanging
bartizan, over which there rose a sharp serrated gable,
to the height of about two stories more. A row of circular
shot-holes, and a low, narrow door-way, were the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
openings in the lower storey&mdash;the few windows in the
upper, long and narrow, and scarce equal in size to a
Norman shield, were thickly barred with iron. The building
had altogether a dilapidated and deserted appearance;
for the turrets were broken-edged and mouldering, and
some of the large square flags had slidden from off the
stone roof, and lay in the moat, which, from a reservoir, had
degenerated into a quagmire, mantled over with aquatic
plants, and with, here and there, a bush of willow springing
out from the sides. A single plank afforded a rather
doubtful passage across; and the iron-studded door of the
fortalice lay wide open. Clelland hung back as the maiden
entered.</p>

<p>"My daughter! my Bertha!" exclaimed a female voice
from within; "and do you yet live! and are you again restored
to me!"</p>

<p>The Knight entered, and found the maiden in the embrace
of her mother.</p>

<p>"That I still live," said Bertha, "I owe it to this brave
and courtly knight. But for his generous daring, your
daughter would have found strange burial in the ravenous
maw of a wolf."</p>

<p>The mother turned round to Clelland, and grasped his
mailed hand in both hers.</p>

<p>"The saints be your blessing and reward!" she exclaimed;
"for I cannot repay you. God himself be your reward!&mdash;for
earth bears no price adequate to the benefit. You have
restored to the lonely and the broken in spirit her only stay
and comfort."</p>

<p>"Nay, madam," said Clelland, "I would have done as
much for the meanest serf; for Bertha de Longoville I
could have laid down my life."</p>

<p>The mother again grasped his hand. She was a tall and
a still beautiful woman, though considerably turned of forty,
and though she yet bore impressed on her countenance no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
unequivocal traces of the distress of the night. She told
them of her sufferings; and was made acquainted in turn
with the frightful adventure in the hermitage, and, more
startling still, with the resolution of her husband to confront
his calumniators at the court of France.</p>

<p>"We must set out instantly on our journey to Paris,
Bertha," said the matron; "your father, in his imminent
peril, must not lack some one, at least to comfort, if not to
assist him."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Clelland, "ere your setting out, you must
first take rest enough, to recover the fatigues and watching
of the night. And, besides, how could two unprotected
females travel through such a country as this? Hear me,
lady: I was hastening to Paris in advance of my party;
but now that I have missed my way and lost my good
steed, they will be all there before me. It matters but
little. My kinsman can well afford wanting a herald. I
shall cast myself on your hospitality for the day; and,
to-morrow, should you feel yourself fully recovered, you
shall set out for Paris, under such convoy as I can afford
you."</p>

<p>Both ladies expressed their warmest gratitude for the
kind and generous offer; and there was that in the thanks
of the younger which Clelland would have deemed price
sufficient for a service much less redolent of pleasure than
that he had just tendered. She was in truth one of the
loveliest women he had ever seen; tall and graceful, and
with a countenance exquisite in form and colour. But,
with all of the bodily and the material that constitutes
beauty, it was mainly to expression, that index of the soul,
that she owed her power. There was a steady light in the
dark hazel eye, joined to an air of quiet, unobtrusive self-possession,
which seemed to sit on the polished and finely
formed forehead, that gave evidence of a strong and equable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mind; while the sweet smile that seemed to lurk about the
mouth, and the air of softness spread over the lower part of
the face, shewed that there mingled with the stronger traits
of her character the feminine gentleness and sweetness of disposition,
so fascinating in the sex. A little girl from one
of the distant cottages entered the building with a milking
pail in her hands.</p>

<p>"Ah, my good Annette," said the matron, "you left me
by much too soon yester-evening; but it matters not now.
You must busy yourself in getting breakfast for us&mdash;meanwhile,
good Sir Knight, this way. The tower is a wild
ruin, but all its apartments are not equally ruinous."</p>

<p>They ascended, by a stair hollowed in the thickness of
the wall, to an upper story. There was but one apartment
on each floor; so that the entire building consisted but of
four, and the two closet-like recesses in the turrets. The
apartment they now entered was lined with dark oak; a
massy table of the same material occupied the centre; and
a row of ponderous stools, like those which Cowper describes
in his "Task," ran along the wall. An immense
chimney, supported by two rude pillars of stone, and piled
with half-charred billets of wood, projected over the floor;
the lintel, an oblong tablet about three feet in height, was
roughened by uncouth heraldic sculptures of merwomen
playing on harps, and two knights in complete armour
fronting each other as in the tilt-yard. The windows were
small and dark, and barred with iron; and through one of
these that opened to the east, the morning sun, now risen
half a spear's length over the forest, found entrance, in a
square slanting rule of yellow light, which fell on the floor
under a square recess in the opposite wall. The little girl
entered immediately after the ladies and Clelland, bearing
fire and fuel; a cheerful blaze soon roared in the chimney;
and, as the morning felt keen and chill after the recent
storm, they seated themselves before it. An hour passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in courtly and animated dialogue, and then breakfast was
served up.</p>

<p>The younger lady would fain have prolonged the conversation&mdash;for
it had turned on the struggles of the Scots, and
the wonderful exploits of Wallace&mdash;had not her mother
reminded her that they stood much in need of rest to
strengthen them for their approaching journey. They both,
therefore, retired to their sleeping apartments in the turrets;
while the knight, providing himself with a bow and a few
arrows, sallied out into the forest. The practice in woodcraft,
which he had acquired under his kinsman, who, in
his reverses, could levy on only the woods and moors, stood
him in so good stead, that, when dinner-time came round,
a noble haunch of venison and two plump pheasants smoked
on the board. But Bertha alone made her appearance.
Her mother, she said, still felt fatigued, and slightly indisposed;
but she trusted to be able to join them in the course
of the evening.</p>

<p>There was nothing Clelland had so anxiously wished for,
when spending the earlier part of the day in the wood, as
some such opportunity of passing a few hours with Bertha.
And yet, now that the opportunity had occurred, he scarce
knew how to employ it. The radiant smile of the maiden&mdash;her
light, elegant form, and lovely features&mdash;had haunted
him all the morning; and he wisely enough thought there
could be but little harm in frankly telling her so. But,
now that the fair occasion had offered, he found that all his
usual frankness had left him, and that he could scarce say
anything, even on matters more indifferent. And, what
seemed not a little strange, too, the maiden was scarcely
more at her ease than himself, and could find not a great
deal more to say. Dinner passed almost in silence; and
Bertha, rising to the square recess in the wall, drew from it
a flagon filled with wine, which she placed before her guest
and a vellum volume, bound in velvet and gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"This," she said, "is a wonderful romaunt, written by a
countryman of yours, of whom I have heard the strangest
stories. Can you tell me aught regarding him?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the knight, taking up the volume, "the book
of Tristram. I am not too young, lady, to have seen the
writer&mdash;the good Thomas of Erceldoune."</p>

<p>"Seen Thomas of Erceldoune! Thomas the Rhymer!"
exclaimed the lady. "And is it sooth that his prophecies
never fail, and that he now lives in Elf-land?"</p>

<p>"Nay, lady, the good Thomas sleeps in Lauderdale, with
his fathers. But we trust much to his prophecies. They
have given us heart and hope amid our darkest reverses.
He predicted the years of oppression and suffering which,
through the death of our good Alexander, have wasted our
country; but he prophesied, also, our deliverance through
my kinsman, Sir William of Elderslie. We have already
seen much of the evil he foresaw, and much, also, of the
good. Scotland, though still threatened by the power of
Edward, is at this moment free."</p>

<p>"I have long wished," said Bertha, "to see those warriors
of Scotland whose fame is filling all Europe. And now that
wish is gratified&mdash;nay, more than gratified."</p>

<p>"You see but one of her minor warriors," said Clelland;
"but at Paris you shall meet with the Governor himself.
Your father, Bertha, should he succeed in clearing his fair
fame&mdash;and I know he will&mdash;sets out with us for Scotland.
Will not you and the lady your mother also accompany
us?"</p>

<p>"I had deemed my father bound on a pilgrimage to the
holy sepulchre," said Bertha.</p>

<p>"But he has since thought," said Clelland, "how much
better it were to live gloriously fighting in a just quarrel
beside the first warrior of the world, than to perish obscurely
in some loathsome pesthouse of the Far East. I myself
heard him tender his services to my kinsman."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then be sure," said Bertha, "my mother and I will
not be separated from him. Might one find in Scotland,
Sir Knight, some such quiet tower as this, where two defenceless
women may bide the issue of the contest?"</p>

<p>"Why defenceless, lady? There are many gallant swords
in Scotland that would needs be beaten down ere you could
come to harm. And why not now accept of Clelland's?
Scotland has greater warriors and better swords; but, trust
me, lady, she cannot boast of a truer heart. Accept of me,
lady, as your bounden knight."</p>

<p>A rich flush of crimson suffused the face and neck of the
maiden, as she held out her hand to Clelland, who raised
it respectfully to his lips.</p>

<p>"I accept of thee, noble warrior," she said, "as true and
faithful knight, seeing that thy own generous tender of service
doth but second what Heaven had purposed, when, in
my imminent peril in the wood, it sent thee to my rescue.
Trust me, warrior, never yet had lady knight whom she respected
more."</p>

<p>Clelland again raised her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"I have a sister, lady," he said, "whose years do not outnumber
your own. She lives lonely, since the death of my
mother, in the home of my fathers&mdash;a tower roomier and
stronger than this, and on the edge of a forest nearly as
widely spread. You will be her companion, lady, and her
friend; and your mother will be mistress of the mansion.
On the morrow, we set out for Paris."</p>

<p>The style in which the party travelled was sufficiently
humble. Four small and very shaggy palfreys were provided
from the neighbouring cottages: the ladies and Clelland
were mounted on three of these; and the fourth, led
by a hind, carried the luggage of the party. Before setting
out, the lady had entrusted to the charge of the knight, a
small, but very ponderous casket of ebony.</p>

<p>"It needs, in these unsettled times," she said, "some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
such person to care for it; and Bertha and I would fare all
the worse for wanting it."</p>

<p>The journey was long and tedious, and the daily stages
of the party necessarily short. Their route lay through a
wild, half-cultivated country, which seemed to owe much
to the hand of nature, but little to that of man. There was
an ever-recurring succession, day after day, of dreary, wide-spreading
forests, with comparatively narrow spaces between,
which, from the imperfect and doubtful traces of industry
which they exhibited, seemed as if but lately reclaimed
from a state of nature. Groups of miserable serfs, bound
to the soil even more rigidly than their fellow-slaves the
cattle, were plying their unskilful and unproductive labours
in the fields. They passed scattered assemblages of dingy
hovels, with here and there a grim feudal tower rising in
the midst&mdash;giving evidence, by the strength of its defences,
of the insecurity and turbulence of the time. The travellers
they met with were but few. Occasionally a strolling
troubadour or harper accompanied them part of the way,
on his journey from one baronial castle to another. At
times, they met with armed parties of travelling merchants,
bound for some distant fair; at times with disbanded artisans,
wandering about in quest of employment; soldiers in
search of a master; or pilgrims newly returned from Palestine,
attired in cloaks of grey, and bearing the scallop in
their caps. The hind, their attendant, bore in his scrip,
from stage to stage, their provisions for the day; and their
evenings were passed in some rude hostelry by the way-side.
The third week had passed, ere, one evening on the
edge of twilight, they alighted at the hostel of St Denis, and
ascertained, from mine host, that they were now within
half a stage of Paris.</p>

<p>The hostel was crowded with travellers; and the ladies
and Clelland, for the early part of the evening, were fain to
take their places in the common room beside the fire. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
young and handsome troubadour, whose jemmy jerkin, and
cap of green, edged with silver, shewed that he was either
one of the more wealthy of his class, or under the patronage
of some rich nobleman, and who had courteously risen to
yield place to Bertha, had succeeded in reseating himself
beside the knight.</p>

<p>"The hostel swarms with company," said Clelland, addressing
him&mdash;"pray, good minstrel, canst tell me the occasion?
Is there a fair holds to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Sir Knight," said the minstrel, "I should rather
ask of thee, seeing thy tongue shews thee to be a Scot.
Dost not know that thy countryman, the brave Wallace of
Elderslie, is at court, and that all who can, in any wise,
leave their homes for a season, are leaving them, to see
him? It is not once in a lifetime that such a knight may be
looked at. And, besides, have you not heard that the combat
comes on to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I have heard of nothing," said Clelland; "my route
has lain, of late, through the remoter parts of the country.
What combat?"</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas de Longoville, so long a true soldier of the
cross&mdash;so long, too, a wandering pirate&mdash;has defied to
mortal combat, Loithaire of Languedoc; and our fair
Philip, through the intercession of Wallace, has granted
him the lists."</p>

<p>Both the ladies started at the intelligence; and the elder,
wrapping up her face in her mantle, bent her head well
nigh to her knee.</p>

<p>"And how, good minstrel," said Bertha, in a voice tremulous
from anxiety, "how is it thought the combat will go?"</p>

<p>"That rests with Heaven, fair lady," said the minstrel.
"Loithaire is known far and wide, as a striker in the lists;
but who has not also heard of De Longoville, and his wars
with the fierce Saracen? Many seem to think, too, that
he has been foully injured by Loithaire. That soul of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
knightly honour, the good Lord Jonville, has already renewed
his friendship with him, as his friend and comrade
in the battles of Palestine, and will attend him to-morrow
in the lists."</p>

<p>"May all the saints reward him!" ejaculated the elder
lady.</p>

<p>"And at what hour, Sir Minstrel," asked the knight,
"does the combat come on?"</p>

<p>"At the turn of noon," replied the minstrel, "when the
shadow first veers to the east. I go to Paris, to find new
theme for a ballad, and to see the good Wallace, who is
himself the theme of so many."</p>

<p>The travellers were early on the road. With all their
haste and anxiety, however, they saw the sun climbing towards
the middle heavens, while the city was yet several
miles distant. They spurred on their jaded palfreys, and
entered the suburbs about noon. What was properly the
city of Paris in this age, occupied one of the larger islands
of the Seine, and was surrounded by a high wall, flanked
at the angles by massy towers, and strengthened by rows
of thickly-set buttresses; but, on either side the river, there
were immense assemblages of the dirtiest and meanest
hovels that the necessities of man had ever huddled together.
The travellers, however, found but little time for
remark in passing through. All Paris had poured out her
inhabitants, to witness the combat, and they now crowded
an upper island of the Seine, which the chivalry of the age
had appropriated as a scene of games, tournaments, and
duels. Clelland and the ladies had but reached the opposite
bank, when a flourish of trumpets told them that the combatants
had taken their places in the lists, and were waiting
the signal to engage.</p>

<p>"No further, ladies, no further," said the knight, "or we
shall entangle ourselves in the outer skirts of the crowd,
and see nothing. This way; let us ascend this eminence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and the scene, though somewhat distant, will be all before
us."</p>

<p>They ascended a smooth green knoll, the burial mound
of some chieftain of the olden time, that overlooked the
river. The island lay but a short furlong away. They
could look over the heads of the congregated thousands into
the open lists, and see the brilliant assemblage of the beauty
and gallantry of France, which the fame of De Longoville
and his opponent, and the singular nature of their quarrel,
had drawn together. The sun glanced gaily on arms and
armour, on many a robe of rich embroidery and many
a costly jewel, and high over the whole, the oriflame of
France, so famous in story, waved its flames of crimson and
gold to the breeze. Knights and squires traversed the area,
in gay and glittering confusion; and at either end there sat
a warrior on horseback, as still and motionless as if sculptured
in bronze. The champion at the northern end was
cased from head to foot in sable armour, and beside him,
under the blue pennon of Scotland, there stood a group of
knights, who, though tall and stately as any in the lists,
seemed lessened almost to boys in the presence of a gigantic
warrior in bright mail, who, like Saul among the people,
raised his head and shoulders over the proud crests of the
assembled chivalry of France.</p>

<p>"Yonder, ladies&mdash;yonder is my kinsman," exclaimed
Clelland; "yonder is Wallace of Elderslie; and the champion
beside him is Sir Thomas de Longoville."</p>

<p>There was a second flourish of trumpets. Bertha flung
herself on her knees on the sward, and raised her hands to
her eyes. Her mother almost fainted outright.</p>

<p>"Nay," said Clelland, "that is but the signal to clear the
lists; the knights hurry behind the palisades, and the champions
are left alone. Fear not, dearest Bertha!&mdash;there is a
God in heaven, and&mdash;&mdash;Ah, there is the third flourish!
The champions strike their spurs deep into their chargers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and see how they rush forward, like thunder clouds before a
hurricane! They close!&mdash;they close!&mdash;hark to the crash!&mdash;their
steeds are thrown back on their haunches! Look up,
Bertha! look up!&mdash;your father has won&mdash;he has won!
Loithaire is flung from his saddle, the spear of De Longoville
has passed through hauberk and corslet; I saw the
steel head glitter red at the felon's back. Look up, ladies!
look up!&mdash;De Longoville is safe; nay, more&mdash;restored to the
honour and fair fame of his early manhood. Let us hasten
and join him, that we may add our congratulations to those
of his friends."</p>

<p>Why dwell longer on the story of Thomas de Longoville?
No Scotsman acquainted with Blind Harry need be told how
frequent and honourable the mention of his name occurs in
the latter pages of that historian. Scotland became his adopted
country, and well and chivalrously did he fight in her battles;
till, at length, when well nigh worn out by the fatigues
and hardships of a long and active life, the decisive victory
at Bannockburn gave him to enjoy an old age of peace and
leisure, in the society of his lady, on the lands of his son-in-law.
Need we add it was the gallant Clelland who stood
in this relation to him? The chosen knight of Bertha had
become her favoured lover, and the favoured lover a fond
and devoted husband. Of the Governor more anon. There
was a time, at least, when Scotsmen did not soon weary of
stories of the Wight Wallace.</p>

<h2>THE FUGITIVE.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>


<p>When Prince Charles Edward, at the head of his hardy
Highlanders, took up his head-quarters in Edinburgh, issuing
proclamations and holding levees, amongst those who
attended the latter was a young Englishman, named Henry
Blackett, then a student at the university, and the son of a
Sir John Blackett of Winburn Priory, in Cheshire. His
mother had been a Miss Cameron, a native of Inverness-shire,
and the daughter of a poor but proud military officer.
From her he had imbibed principles or prejudices in favour
of the house of Stuart; and when he had been introduced
to the young adventurer at Holyrood, and witnessed the
zeal of his army, his enthusiasm was kindled&mdash;there was a
romance in the undertaking which pleased his love of enterprise,
and he resolved to offer his sword to the Prince,
and hazard his fortunes with him. The offer was at once
graciously and gratefully accepted, and Henry Blackett was
enrolled as an officer in the rebel army.</p>

<p>He followed the Prince through prosperity and adversity,
and when Charles became a fugitive in the land of his
fathers, Henry Blackett was one of the last to forsake him.
He, too, was hunted from one hiding-place to another; like
him whom he had served, he was a fugitive, and a price
was set upon his head.</p>

<p>As has been stated, he imbibed his principles in favour
of the house of Stuart from his mother; but she had been
dead for several years. His father was a weak man&mdash;one
of whom it may be said that he had no principles at all;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
but being knighted by King George, on the occasion of his
performing some civic duty, he became a violent defender
of the house of Brunswick, and he vowed that, if the law
did not, he would disinherit his son for having taken up
arras in defence of Charles. But what chiefly strengthened
him in this resolution, was not so much his devotion for
the reigning family, as his attachment to one Miss Norton,
the daughter of a Squire Norton of Norton Hall. She was
a young lady of much beauty, and mistress of what are
called accomplishments; but, in saying this much, I have
recorded all her virtues. Her father's character might be
summed up in one brief sentence&mdash;he was a deep, designing,
needy villain. He was a gambler&mdash;a gentleman by
birth&mdash;a knave in practice. He had long been on terms of
familiarity with Sir John Blackett&mdash;he knew his weakness,
and he knew his wealth, and he rejoiced in the attachment
which he saw him manifesting for his daughter, in the hope
that it would be the means of bringing his estates within
his control. But the property of Sir John being entailed,
it consequently would devolve on Henry as his only surviving
son. He, therefore, was an obstacle to the accomplishment
of the schemes on which Norton brooded; and
when the latter found that he had joined the army of the
young Chevalier, he was chiefly instrumental in having his
name included in the list of those for whose apprehension
rewards were offered; and he privately, and at his own expense,
employed spies to go in quest of him. He also endeavoured
to excite his father more bitterly against him.
Nor did his designs rest here&mdash;but, as he beheld the fondness
of the knight for his daughter increase, he, with the
cunning of a demon, proposed to him to break the entail;
and when the other inquired how it could be done, he replied&mdash;"Nothing
is more simple; deny him to be your heir&mdash;pronounce
him illegitimate. There is no living witness of
your marriage with his mother. The only document to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
prove it is some thumbed leaf in the register of an obscure
parish church in the Highlands of Scotland; and we can
secure it."</p>

<p>To this most unnatural proposal the weak and wicked old
man consented; and I shall now describe the means employed
by Norton to become possessed of the parish register
referred to.</p>

<p>Squire Norton had a son who was in all respects worthy
of such a father&mdash;he was the image of his mind and person.
In short, he was one of the <i>things</i> who, in those days, resembled
those who in our own call themselves <i>men of the
world</i>, forsooth! and who, under that name, infest and corrupt
society&mdash;making a boast of their worthlessness&mdash;poisoning
innocence&mdash;triumphing in their work of ruin&mdash;and laughing,
like spirits of desolation, over the daughter's misery and
disgrace, the father's anguish, the wretched mother's tears,
and the shame of a family, which they have accomplished.
There are such creatures, who disgrace both the soul and the
shape of man, who are mere shreds and patches of debauchery&mdash;sweepings
from the shops of the tailor, the milliner, and
the hair-dresser&mdash;who live upon the plunder obtained under
false pretences from the industrious&mdash;who giggle, ogle, pat
a snuff-box, or affect to nod in a church, to be thought sceptics
or fine gentlemen. One of such was young Norton;
and he was sent down to Scotland to destroy the only proof
which Henry Blackett, in the event of his being pardoned,
could bring forward in support of his legitimacy.</p>

<p>He arrived at a lonely village in Inverness-shire, near
which the cottage formerly occupied by Major Cameron, the
grandfather of Henry, was situated; and of whom he found
that few of the inhabitants remembered more than that
"there lived a man." Finding the only inn that was in the
village much more cleanly and comfortable than he had
anticipated, he resolved to make it his hotel during his residence,
and inquired of the landlady if there were any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in the village with whom a gentleman could spend an evening,
and obtain information respecting the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Fu' shurely! fu' shurely, sir!" replied his Highland
hostess&mdash;"there pe te auld tominie."</p>

<p>"Who?" inquired he, not exactly comprehending her
Celtic accent.</p>

<p>"Wha put te auld tominie?" returned she; "an' a tiscreet,
goot shentleman he pe as in a' te toun."</p>

<p>"The dominie?&mdash;the dominie?" he repeated, in a tone of
perplexity.</p>

<p>"Oigh! oigh! te tominie," added she, "tat teaches te pits
o' pairns, an' raises te psalm in te kirk."</p>

<p>He now comprehended her meaning; and from her coupling
the dominie's name with the kirk, believed that he
might be of use to him in the accomplishment of his object,
and desired that he might be sent for.</p>

<p>"Oigh!" returned she, smiling, "an' he no pe lang, for
he like te trappie unco weel."</p>

<p>Within five minutes, Dugald Mackay, precentor, teacher,
and parish-clerk of Glencleugh, entered the parlour of Mrs
Macnab. Never was a more striking contrast exhibited in
castle or in cottage. Here stood young Norton, bedecked
with all the foppery of an exquisite of his day; and there
stood Dugald Mackay, his thick bushy grey hair falling on
his shoulders, holding in his hand a hat not half the size of
his head, which had neither been made nor bought for him,
and which had become brown with service, and was now
stitched in many places, to keep it together. Round it was
wrapped a narrow stripe of crape browner than itself, and
over all winded several yards of gut and hair-line, with hooks
attached, betokening his angling propensities. Dugald was
a thickset old man, with a face blooming like his native
heather. His feet were thrust into immense brogues, as
brown as his hat, and their formidable patches shewed that
their wearer could use the <i>lingle</i> and <i>elshun</i>, although his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
profession was to "teach the young idea how to shoot."
He wore tartan hose&mdash;black breeches, fastened at the knees
by silver gilt buckles, and much the worse for the wear, while,
from the accumulation of ink and dust, they might have
stood upright. His vest was huge and double-breasted, its
colour not recognised by painters; and his shoulders were
covered by a very small tartan coat, the tails of which
hardly reached his waist. Such was Dugald Mackay; and
the youth, plying him with the bottle, endeavoured to ascertain
how far he could render him subservient to his
purpose.</p>

<p>"You appear fond of angling," said Norton.</p>

<p>"Fond o' fishing?" returned the man of letters; "ou ay;
ou ay!&mdash;hur hae mony time filt te creel o' te shentlemen
frae Inverness, for te sixpence, and te shilling, and te pig
crown, not to let tem gaun pack wi' te empty pasket. And
hur will teach your honour, or tress your honour's hooks,
should you be stopping to fish. Here pe goot sport to your
honour," continued he, raising a bumper to his lips.</p>

<p>The other, glad to assign a plausible pretext for his visit,
said that he had come a few days for the sake of fishing, and
inquired how long his guest had been in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"Hur peen schulemaister and parish-clerk in Glencleugh
for forty year," replied Dugald.</p>

<p>"Parish-clerk!" said Norton, eagerly, and checking himself,
continued&mdash;"that is&mdash;in the church you mean, you
raise the tunes?"</p>

<p>"Ou ay, hur nainsel' pe precenter too," answered
Dugald; "put hur be schulemaister and parish-clerk into
te pargain."</p>

<p>"And what are your duties as parish-clerk?" inquired
the other, in a tone of indifference.</p>

<p>"Ou, it pe to keep te pooks wi' te marriages, te christenings,
and te deaths. Here pe to your honour's very goot
luck again," said he, swallowing another bumper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the holder of the birch and parish chronicler began
to help himself to one glass after another, until the candles
began to dance reels and strathspeys before him. At length
the angler, expressing a wish to see such a curiosity as the
matrimonial and baptismal register of a hamlet so remote,
out sallied Dugald, describing curved lines as he went, and
shortly returned, bearing the eventful quartos under his
arm. Norton looked through them, laughing, jesting, and
professing to be amused, and his eye quickly fell upon the
page which he sought. Dugald laughed, drank, and talked,
until his rough head sank upon his breast, and certain nasal
sounds gave notice that the schoolmaster was abroad. In a
moment, Norton transferred the leaf which contained the
certificate of Lady Blackett's marriage, from the volume to
his pocket. His father had ordered him to destroy it; but
the son, vicious as the father, determined to keep it, and to
hold it over him as an instrument of terror to extort money.
The dominie being roused to take one glass more by way of
a night-cap, was led home, as usual, by Mrs Macnab's servant-of-all-work,
who carried the volumes.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the marriage between Sir John Blackett
and Miss Norton took place; her father rejoiced in the
success of his schemes, and Henry was disinherited and
disowned.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>


<p>While the latter events which we have recorded in the
last chapter were taking place, Henry Blackett, the rebel
soldier, was a fugitive, flying from hiding-place to hiding-place,
seeking concealment in the mountains and in the
glens, in the forest and crowded city, assuming every disguise,
and hunted from covert to covert. A reward was
not offered for his apprehension, in particular by government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
but he was included amongst those whom loyal subjects
were forbidden to conceal; and two emissaries, sent
out by Norton, sought him continually, to deliver him up.
Ignorant of his father's marriage, or of the villain's part he
had acted towards him, though conscious of his anger at
his having joined Prince Charles, he was wandering in
Dumfries-shire, by the shores of the Solway, disguised as a
sailor, and watching an opportunity to return home, when
the hunters after his life suddenly sprang upon him, exclaiming&mdash;"Ha!
Blackett, the traitor!&mdash;the five hundred
pounds are ours!"</p>

<p>Armed only with the branch of a tree, which he carried
partly for defence, and as a walking-stick, he repelled them
with the desperate fierceness of a man whose life is at stake.
One he disabled, and the other being unable to contend
against him singly, permitted him to escape. He rushed
at his utmost speed across the fields for many miles, avoiding
the highways and public paths, until he sank panting
and exhausted on the ground. He had not lain long in
this situation when he was discovered by a wealthy farmer,
who was known in the neighbourhood by the appellation of
"canny Willie Galloway."</p>

<p>"Puir young chield," said Willie, casting on him a look
of compassion, "ye seem sadly distressed. Do ye think I
could be o' ony service to ye? From yer appearance, ye
wadna be the waur o' a nicht's lodging, and I can only
say that ye are heartily welcome to't."</p>

<p>Henry had been so long the object of pursuit and persecution,
that he regarded every one with suspicion; and
starting to his feet and grasping the branch firmer in his
hand, he said&mdash;"Know you what you say?&mdash;or would you
betray the wretched?"</p>

<p>"It is o' nae manner o' use gripping your stick," said
Willie, calmly, "for I'm allooed to be a first-rate cudgel-player&mdash;the
best atween Stranraer and Dumfries. But, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to kennin' what I said, I was offerin' ye a nicht's lodgings;
and as to betrayin' the wretched, I wadna see a hawk strike
doon a sparrow, not a spider a midge, if I could prevent
it."</p>

<p>"You seem honest," said Henry; "I am miserable, and
will trust you."</p>

<p>"Be thankit," answered the other; "I dare to say I'm
as honest as my neebors; and, as ye seem in distress, I
will be very happy to serve ye, if I can do't in a creditable
way."</p>

<p>Willie Galloway was a bachelor of five and forty, and
his house was kept by an old woman, a distant relative,
called Janet White. Henry accompanied him home, and
communicated to him his story. Willie took a liking for
him, and vowed that he would not only shelter him, while
he had a roof over his head, but that he would defend him
against every enemy, while he had a hand that he could
lift; and, the better to ensure his concealment, he proposed
that he should pass as his sister's son, and not even write
to his father to intimate where he was, until the persecution
against those who had "been <i>out</i> with poor Charlie," was
past.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Willie's farm, there resided an
elderly gentleman, named Laird Howison. He was an
eccentric but most kind-hearted man, of whom many believed
and said that his imagination was stronger then his reason;
and in so saying, it was probable that they were not far from
the truth. But of that the reader will determine as he sees
more of the laird. There resided with him a beautiful
orphan girl, named Helen Marshall, the daughter of the late
parish clergyman, and to whom he had been left guardian
from her childhood. But, as she grew up in loveliness before
him, she became as a dream of futurity that soothed and
cheered his existence; and, although he was already on the
wrong side of fifty, he resolved that, as soon as she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
twenty-one, he would offer her his hand and fortune. Janet
White, the housekeeper and relative of Willie Galloway,
had nursed Helen in infancy; and the lovely maiden was,
therefore, a frequent visitor at his house. She there met
Henry, and neither saw nor listened to him with indifference;
and her beauty, sense, and gentleness, made a like impression
upon him. Willie, though a bachelor, had penetration
enough to perceive that when they met there was meaning
in their eyes; and he began to rally Henry&mdash;saying, "Now,
there would be a match for ye!&mdash;when the storm has blawn
owre your head, just tak ye that bonny Scotch lassie hame
to England wi' ye as yer wife, and ye will find her a treasure,
such as ye may wander the world round and no find
her marrow."</p>

<p>As their intimacy and affection increased, Henry communicated
to Helen the secret of his birth and situation;
and, like a true woman, she loved him the more for the
dangers to which he was exposed. He had remained more
than eight months with his friend and protector; and, imagining
that the persecution against himself, and others who
had acted in the same cause, was now abated in its fury, he
forwarded a letter to his father, at Winburn Priory, announcing
his intention of venturing home in a few days,
and begging his forgiveness and protection, until his pardon
could be procured. He, however, intimated to Willie Galloway,
his desire to secure the hand of Helen before he left.</p>

<p>"Weel, if she be agreeable," said Willie "&mdash;and I hae
every reason to believe she is&mdash;I wadna blame ye for taking
that step ava; for her auld gowk o' a guardian, Laird
Howison, (though a very worthy man in some respecks),
vows that he is determined to marry her himsel, as soon as
she is ane and twenty; and, as he is up aboot London at
present, ye couldna hae a better opportunity. Therefore,
only ye and Helen say the word, and I'll arrange the business
for ye in less than nae time."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The fair maiden consented; a clergyman had joined their
hands, and pronounced the benediction over them&mdash;the
ceremony was concluded, but it was only concluded, when
the two ruffians, who have been already mentioned as hired
by Norton to search for him and secure his apprehension,
and who before had met him by the side of the Solway,
followed by two soldiers, burst into the apartment, crying&mdash;"Secure
the traitor! It is he!&mdash;Harry Blackett!"</p>

<p>Helen screamed aloud and clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"Ye lie! ye lie!" cried Willie&mdash;"it is my sister's son&mdash;meddle
wi' him wha daur, and us twa will fecht you four,
even in the presence o' the minister."</p>

<p>So saying, he seized hold of a chair, and raised it to repel
them. Henry followed his example. The soldiers threateningly
raised their fire-arms. Willie suddenly swang round
the chair with his utmost strength, and dashed down their
arms. Henry hastily kissed the brow of his fair bride, and,
rushing through the midst of them, darted from the house,
while Willie, as rapidly following him, closed the door behind
him, and holding it fast, cried&mdash;"Run, Harry, my lad!&mdash;run
for bare life, and I'll keep them fast here!"</p>

<p>For several days, the soldiers searched the neighbourhood
for the fugitive; but they found him not, and no one knew
where he had fled. Within a week, Helen disappeared from
Primrose Hall, the seat of her guardian, Laird Howison;
and the general belief was, that she had set out for Cheshire,
to the father of her bridegroom, to intercede with him to
use his influence in his son's behalf. "And," said Willie,
"if she doesna move him to forgie his son, and do his duty
towards him, then I say that he has a heart harder than a
whin-rock."</p>

<p>But no one knew the object of her departure, nor whither
she had gone. Laird Howison had not returned; and, after
several weeks had passed, and Willie Galloway was unable
to hear ought of either Helen or Henry, he resolved to proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to Cheshire, to make inquiries after them; and for this
purpose purchased an entire suit of new and fashionable
raiment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>


<p>On a beautiful summer morning, an old man, slightly
stooping in his gait, was slowly walking down a green lane
which led in the direction from Warrington to Winburn
Priory. Behind him, at a rapid pace, followed a younger
man, of a muscular frame, exceedingly well-dressed, and
carrying over his arm a thick chequered plaid, like those
worn in the pastoral districts of Scotland. He overtook the
elder pedestrian, and accosted him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here's a bonny morning, freend."</p>

<p>"Sir?" said the old man inquiringly, slightly lifting his
hat, and not exactly comprehending his companion.</p>

<p>"Losh, but he's a mannerly auld body that," thought the
other; "I see the siller upon this suit o' claes has been
weel-wared;" and added aloud, "I was observing it's a delightful
morning, sir, and as delightful a country-side; it
wad be a paradise, were it no sae flat."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir!" replied the old man; "but I fear as how the
country looks like a paradise without its innocence."</p>

<p>"Ye talk very rationally, honest man," said the other,
whom the reader will have recognised to be Willie Galloway;
"and, if I am no mistaen, ye maun hae some cause
to mak the remark. But, dear me, sir, only look round ye,
and see the trees in a' their glory, the flowers in a' their innocence;
or just look at the rowing burn there, wimplin
alang by oor side, like refined silver, beneath a sun only less
glorious than the Hand that made it; and see hoo the bits
o' fish are whittering round, wagging their tails, and whisking
back and forrit, as happy as kings! Look at the lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and the cheerfu' face o' a' Nature&mdash;or just listen to the
music o' thae sinless creatures in the hedges, and in the blue
lift&mdash;and ye will say that, but for the inventions and deceitfulness
o' man's heart, this earth wad be a paradise still.
But I tell ye what, freend&mdash;I believe that were an irreligious
man just to get up before sunrise at a season like this, and
gang into the fields and listen to the laverock, and look
around on the earth, and on the majesty o' the heavens
rising, he wadna stand for half-an-hoor until, if naebody
were seeing him, he would drap doun on his knees and
pray."</p>

<p>Much of Willie's sermon was lost on the old man; he,
however, comprehended a part, and said, "Why, sir, I know
as how I always find my mind more in tune for the service
of the church, by a walk in the fields, and the singing of the
birds, than by all the instruments of the orchestra."</p>

<p>"Orchestra!" said Willie, "what do ye mean?&mdash;that's a
strange place to gather devotion frae!"</p>

<p>"The orchestra of the church," returned the other.</p>

<p>"The orchestra o' the church!" said Willie, in surprise&mdash;"what's
that? I never heard o't before. There's the poopit,
and the precentor's desk, the pews and the square seats, and
doun stairs and the gallery&mdash;but ye nonplus me about the
orchestra."</p>

<p>"Why, our lord of the manor," continued the old man,
"is one who cares for nothing that's good, and he will give
nothing; and as we are not rich enough to buy an organ,
we have only a bass viol, two tenors, and a flute."</p>

<p>"Fiddles and a flute in a place o' worship!" exclaimed
Willie.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the other, marvelling at his manner.</p>

<p>"Weel," returned Willie, standing suddenly still, and
striking his staff upon the ground, "that beats a'! And
will ye tell me, sir, hoo it is possible to worship yer Creator
by scraping catgut, or blawing wind through a hollow stick?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, master," said the old man, "the use of instruments
in worship is as old as the times of the prophets, and
I can't see why it should be given up. But dost thou think,
now, that thou couldst go into Chester cathedral at twilight,
while the organ filled all round about thee with its deep
music, without feeling in thy heart that thou wast in a
house of praise. Why, sir, at such a time thou couldst not
commit a wicked action. The very sound, while it lifted up
thy soul with delight, would awe thee."</p>

<p>When their controversy had ended, Willie inquired&mdash;"Do
ye ken a family o' the name o' Blackett, that lives aboot this
neeborhood?"</p>

<p>"I should," answered the old man; "forty years did I
eat of their bread."</p>

<p>"Then, after sic lang service, ye'll just be like ane o' the
family?" replied Willie.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the other, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Ye dinna mean to say," resumed Willie, in a tone of
surprise, "that they hae turned ye aff, in your auld age, as
some heartless wretch wad sell the noble animal that had
carried him when a callant, to a cadger, because it had
grown howe-backet, and lost its speed o' foot. But I hope
that young Mr Henry had nae hand in it?"</p>

<p>"Henry!&mdash;no! no!" cried the old man eagerly&mdash;"bless
him! Did you know Mr Henry, your honour?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Willie; "and I hae come from Scotland
ance errand to see him."</p>

<p>"But, sir," inquired the old man, tremulously, "do you
know where to find him?"</p>

<p>"I expect to find him, by this time, at his father's house."</p>

<p>"Alas!" answered the old domestic, "there has been no
one at the priory for more than twelve months. I don't
know where the old knight is. Henry has not been here
since he went to Edinburgh, and that is nigh to five years
gone now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye dumfounder me, auld man," exclaimed Willie;
"but where, in the name o' guidness, where's the wife?&mdash;where's
Mrs Blackett?"</p>

<p>"You will mean your countrywoman, I suppose," said
the other.</p>

<p>"To be sure I mean her," said Willie&mdash;"wha else could
I mean?"</p>

<p>"Ah! wo is me!" sighed his companion, and he burst
into tears as he spoke, "dost see the churchyard, just
before us?&mdash;and they have raised no stone to mark the
spot."</p>

<p>"Dead!" ejaculated Willie, becoming pale with horror,
and fixing upon his fellow-pedestrian a look of agony&mdash;"Ye
dinna say&mdash;dead!"</p>

<p>"Even so!&mdash;even so!" said the old domestic, sobbing
aloud.</p>

<p>"And hoo was it?" cried Willie; "was it a fair strae
death&mdash;or just grief, puir thing&mdash;just grief?"</p>

<p>"Why, I can't say how it was," answered his informant;
"but I wish I durst tell all I think."</p>

<p>"Say it!&mdash;say it!" exclaimed Willie, vehemently, "what
do you mean by, if you durst say all you think? If there
be the shadow o' foul play, I will sift it to the bottom,
though it cost me a thousand pounds; and there is anither
that will gie mair."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, I am but a friendless old man," replied the
other, "that could not stand the weight of a stronger
arm."</p>

<p>"Plague take their arms!" cried Willie, handling his
cudgel, as if to shew the strength of his own&mdash;"tell what
ye think, and they'll have strong arms that dare touch a
hair o' yer head."</p>

<p>"Well, master," was the reply, "I don't like to say too
much to strangers, but if thou makest any stay in these
parts, I may tell thee something; and I fear that wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
poor Henry is, he is in need of friends. But perhaps your
honour would wish to see her grave?"</p>

<p>"Her grave!" ejaculated Willie&mdash;"yes! yes! yes!&mdash;her
grave!&mdash;O misery! have I come frae Dumfries-shire to see
a sicht like this?"</p>

<p>The old man led the way over the stile, hanging his head
and sighing as he went. Willie followed him, drawing his
sleeve across his eyes, as was his custom when his heart
was touched, and forgetting the dress of the gentleman
which he wore, in the feelings of the man.</p>

<p>"The family vault is in yonder corner," said his conductor,
as they turned across the churchyard.</p>

<p>"Save us, friend!" exclaimed Willie, looking towards
the spot, "saw ye ever the like o' yon?&mdash;a poor miserable
dementit creature, wringing his hands as though his heart
would break!"</p>

<p>"Tis he! 'tis he!" shouted the old man, springing forward
with the alacrity of youth, "my child!&mdash;my dear
young master!"</p>

<p>"Oh! conscience o' man!" exclaimed Willie, "what sort
o' a dream is this? It canna be possible! <i>Her</i> dead, and
<i>him</i>, oot o' his judgment, mourning owre her grave in the
garb o' a beggar!"</p>

<p>"Ha! discovered again!" cried Henry fiercely, and
starting round as he spoke; but immediately recognising
the old domestic, on whom time had not wrought such a
metamorphosis as dress had upon Willie Galloway&mdash;"Ha,
Jonathan! old Jonathan Holditch!" he added, "do I again
see the face of a friend!" and instantly discovering Willie,
he sprang forward and grasped his extended hand in both
of his.</p>

<p>The old man sat down upon the grave and wept.</p>

<p>"Don't weep, Jonathan," said Henry, "I trust that we
shall soon have cause to rejoice."</p>

<p>"I wish a' may be richt yet," thought Willie; "I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
him to be rather dementit at the first glance, and <i>rejoice</i> is
rather a strange word to use owre a young wife's grave.
Puir fellow!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Master Henry," said Jonathan, "I do rejoice that
the worst is past; but I must weep too, for there be many
things in all this that I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Nor me either," said Willie; "but ye say ye think
more than ye dare tell."</p>

<p>"Why is it, Jonathan," continued Henry, "that there
is no stone to mark my mother's grave? There is room
enough in our burial place. Why is there nothing to her
memory?" he continued, bending his eyes upon her sepulchre.
"Her <i>memory</i>!" he added; "cold, cruel grave; and
is memory all that is left me of such a parent? Is the dumb
dust, beneath this unlettered stone&mdash;all!&mdash;all! that I can
now call mother? Has she no monument but the tears of
her only surviving child?"</p>

<p>"A' about his mother," muttered Willie, "who has been
dead for four years, and no a word aboot puir Helen! As
sure as I'm a living man this is beyont my comprehension&mdash;I
dinna think he can be <i>a'thegither there</i>!"</p>

<p>Henry turned towards him and said, "I have much to
ask, my dear friend, but my heart is so filled with griefs
and forebodings already, that the words I would utter
tremble on my tongue; but what of my Helen&mdash;tell me,
what of her?"</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she's&mdash;weel," gasped Willie, bewildered; "that
is&mdash;I&mdash;I hope&mdash;I trust&mdash;that&mdash;oh, losh, Mr Blackett, I
dinna ken whare I am, nor what I am saying, for my brain
is as daized as a body's that is driven owre wi' a drift, and
rowed amang the snaw! Has there been onybody buried
here lately?"</p>

<p>"Mr Galloway!&mdash;Mr Galloway!" exclaimed Henry, half-choked
with agitation, and wringing his hand in his, while
the perspiration burst upon his brow&mdash;"in the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
wretchedness&mdash;what&mdash;what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dinna speak to me!" said Willie, waving his hand;
"ask that auld man."</p>

<p>"Jonathan?" exclaimed Henry.</p>

<p>"I don't know what the gentleman means," said the old
man; "but no one has been buried here since your honoured
mother, and that is four years ago."</p>

<p>"And whase grave&mdash;whase grave did ye bring me to look
at?" inquired Willie, eagerly.</p>

<p>"My lady's," answered he.</p>

<p>"Yer leddy's!" returned Willie&mdash;"do you mean Mr
Blackett's mother?"</p>

<p>"Whom else could I mean?" asked old Jonathan, in a
tone of wonder.</p>

<p>"Wha else could you mean!" repeated Willie; "then,
be thankit! <i>she's</i> no dead!&mdash;ye say <i>she's</i> no dead!" and he
literally leapt for joy.</p>

<p>"Who dead?" inquired the old man, with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'increassd'">increased</ins> astonishment.</p>

<p>"Wha dead, ye stupid auld body!&mdash;did I no say <i>his wife</i>,
as plain as I could speak?"</p>

<p>"<i>Whose</i> wife?" inquired Jonathan, looking from Willie
to his master in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Whose wife!" reiterated Willie, weeping, laughing,
and twirling his stick; "shame fa' ye&mdash;ye may ask that
noo, after knocking my heart oot o' the place o't wi' yer
palaver. Whase wife do ye say?&mdash;ask Mr Henry."</p>

<p>"Mr Galloway!" interrupted Henry, "am I to understand
that you believed this to be the grave of my beloved
Helen?&mdash;or, how could you suppose it? Has she left
Primrose Hall?&mdash;or, has our marriage&mdash;&mdash;Tell me all you
know, for I wist not what I would ask."</p>

<p>Willie then related to him what the reader already knows&mdash;namely,
that she had left Dumfries-shire, and was supposed
to have gone to his father's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blessings on the day that these eyes beheld the dear
lady, then," exclaimed old Jonathan; "for I could vow that
she is under my roof now."</p>

<p>"Under <i>your</i> roof!" cried Henry.</p>

<p>"Was ye doited, auld man, that ye didna tell me that
before?" said Willie.</p>

<p>"I knew no more of my young master's marriage, until
just now, than these gravestones do," said Jonathan; "the
dear lady who is with us told nothing to me. Only my
wife told me that she knew she loved our young master."</p>

<p>"But why is she lodging with you, Jonathan? I have
learned that my father is abroad, and is it that he is soon
expected home?"</p>

<p>"A fever caused her to be an inmate of my poor roof,"
answered Jonathan, "after she had been rudely driven from
the gate as a common beggar. But I am no longer thy
father's servant&mdash;and I wish, for thy sake, I could forget
he was thy father; for he has done that which might make
the blessed bones beneath our feet start from their grave.
And there is no one about the Priory now, but the creatures
of the villain Norton."</p>

<p>Henry entreated that the old man would not speak
harshly of his father, though he had so treated them; and
he briefly informed them, that, on flying from Scotland to
escape his pursuers even at his father's lodge, he again met
one of the individuals who had hunted him as "Blackett,
the traitor," and who had attempted to seize him in the
hour of his marriage&mdash;and that even there the cry was again
raised against him; and a band, thirsting for his blood-money,
joined in the pursuit. He had fled to the churchyard,
and found concealment in the family vault, where he
had remained until they then discovered him, as, in the
early morning, he had ventured out.</p>

<p>Willie counselled that there was now small vengeance to
be apprehended from the persecution of the government;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and when Jonathan stated that Sir John had married the
daughter of Norton, and disinherited Henry by denying his
marriage with his mother, Willie exclaimed&mdash;"I see it a',
Mr Henry, just as clear as the A, B, C. This rascal, ye ca'
Norton, or your faither, (forgie me for saying sae,) has employed
the villains wha hunted for yer life; it has been
mair them than the government that has been to blame.
Therefore, my advice is, let us go and drive the thieves out
o' the house by force."</p>

<p>Henry, who was speechless with grief, horror, and disgust,
agreed to the proposition of his friend, and they proceeded
to the Priory by a shorter road than the lodge.</p>

<p>Henry knocked loudly at the door, which was opened by
a man-servant, who attempted to shut it in his face; but,
in a moment the door was driven back upon its hinges, and
the menial lay extended along the lobby; and Henry, with
his sturdy ally, and old Jonathan, rushed in. Alarmed by
the sound, the other servants, male and female, hurried to
the spot; and epithets, too opprobrious to be written, were
the mildest they applied to the young heir, as he demanded
admission.</p>

<p>"Then let us gie them club-law for it," cried Willie, "if
they will have it; and they shall have it to their heart's
content, if I ance begin it."</p>

<p>Armed with such weapons as they could seize at the moment,
the servants menacingly opposed their entrance; but
Henry, dashing through them, rushed towards the stairs,
where he was followed by four men-servants, two armed
with swords, and the others with kitchen utensils.</p>

<p>But Willie, following at their heels, cried&mdash;"Come back!"
and, bringing his cudgel round his head, with one tremendous
swoop caused it to rattle across the unprotected legs
of the two last of the pursuers, and, almost at the same
instant, before their comrades had ascended five steps from
the ground, they, from the same cause, descended backwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
rolling and roaring over their companions. Within
three seconds, all four were conquered, disarmed, and unable
to rise. As the discomfited garrison of the Priory
gathered themselves together, (much in the attitude of
Turks or tailors,) groaning, writhing, and ruefully rubbing
their stockings, Willie, with the composed look of a philosopher,
addressed to them this consoling and important information&mdash;"Noo,
sirs, I hope ye are a' <i>sensibly</i> convinced,
what guid service a bit hazel may do in a willing hand;
and if ony o' yer banes are broken, I would recommend ye
to send for the doctor before the swelling gets stiff about
them. But ye couldna hae broken banes at a cannier place
on a' the leg than just where I gied ye the bits o' clinks;
they were hearty licks, and would gie them a clean snap,
so that, in the matter o' six weeks, ye may be on your feet
again."</p>

<p>Old Jonathan had already followed Henry up stairs; and
Willie having finished his exhortation, proceeded in quest
of them. Henry succeeded in obtaining a change of raiment;
and having sent for one who had been long a tenant
upon the estate, he left the house in charge to him, with
orders that he should immediately turn from it all the creatures
of Norton, and engage other servants; and he and his
friend, Willie, proceeded to the house of old Jonathan,
where, as the latter supposed, a lady that he believed to be
the wife of his young master, then was.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>


<p>Mrs Holditch (the wife of old Jonathan) was wandering
up the lane in quest of her husband, wondering at the
length of his absence, and fretting for his return; for "the
sweet lady," as she termed Helen, "would not take breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
without them." She had proceeded about half a mile
from the cottage, when she was met by none other than
Laird Howison of Primrose Hall, and the following dialogue
took place:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will ye hae the kindness to inform me, ma'am, if the
person that used to keep the gate of Sir John Blackett lives
ony way aboot here?"</p>

<p>"He does, sir," replied she, with low obeisance.</p>

<p>"And, oh!" interrupted he, earnestly, "know ye if there
be a young leddy frae Scotland stopping there at present&mdash;for
I have heard that there is? Ye'll no think me inquisitive,
ma'am; for really if ye kenned what motive I hae for
asking, ye would think it motive enough."</p>

<p>"There be, your honour," returned she, "and a dear excellent
young lady she is."</p>

<p>"Oh! if it be her that I mean," said he, "that she is
<i>dear</i>, indeed, I have owre guid reason to ken, and her excellence
is written on every line o' her beautiful countenance.
But, if I'm no detaining ye, ma'am, may I just ask
her name?"</p>

<p>"She bade us call her Helen, sir," replied she; "we
know no other."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" cried he, "it's just Helen!&mdash;Helen, and
nothing else to me! Mony a time has that name been
offered up wi' my prayers. But I thought, ma'am, ye said
she bade <i>you</i> call her Helen."</p>

<p>"Yes, your honour," said she; "I be the wife of old
Jonathan Holditch, and she be staying with us now."</p>

<p>"Bless you!" he exclaimed, "for the shelter which yer
roof has afforded to the head o' an orphan. But, oh!
what like is <i>your</i> Helen? Is her neck whiter than the
drifted snaw? Does her hair fa' in gowden ringlets, like
the clouds that curl round the brows o' the setting sun?
Is her form delicate as the willow, but stately as the young
pine? Is her countenance beautiful as the light o' laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
day, when it chases sickness and darkness together
from the chamber o' the invalid? If she isna a' this&mdash;if
her voice isna sweeter than the sough o' music on a river&mdash;dear
and excellent she may be, and they may call her
Helen&mdash;but, oh! she isna my <i>Helen</i>!&mdash;for there is none in
the world like unto <i>mine</i>. But, no! no!&mdash;she is <i>not mine
now</i>! O Helen, woman! did I expect this? Excuse me,
ma'am, ye'll think my conduct strange; but, when my poor
seared-up heart thinks o' past enjoyment, it makes me forget
mysel'. Do you think your Helen is the same that I
hae come to seek?"</p>

<p>"A sweeter and a lovelier lady," said she, "never called
Christian man father. She had business at Winburn
Priory; but my husband says she was driven away from the
gate like a dog."</p>

<p>"It is her!" exclaimed he, "and she's no been at the
Priory, then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," returned she.</p>

<p>"Nor seen ony o' the Blackett family?" added he,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, sir; for there be none of them in the neighbourhood,"
answered she.</p>

<p>"What's this I hear!" cried he:&mdash;"Gracious! if I may
again hope!&mdash;and why for no? But how is it that she
is stopping wi' you?&mdash;wherefore did she not return to
the home where she has been cherished from infancy, and
where she will aye be welcome. Has Helen forgot me
a'thegither?"</p>

<p>"Alas, sir!" said she; "it was partly grief, I believe,
that brought on a bad fever, and I had fears the sweet,
patient creature would have died in my hands. I sat by
her bedside, watching night after night; and, oh! sir, I
daresay as how it was about you that she sometimes
talked, and wept, and laughed, and talked again, poor
thing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did <i>ye</i>," he inquired, fumbling with, a pocket
book; "did <i>ye</i> watch owre her? I'm your debtor for
that. And ye think she spoke about <i>me</i>&mdash;my name's Howison,
ma'am&mdash;Thomas Howison of Primrose Hall, in the
county o' Dumfries. She would, maybe, call me <i>Thomas</i>!"</p>

<p>"Mr Howison!" replied the old woman: "yes, your
honour, she often mentioned such a name&mdash;very often."</p>

<p>"Did she really," added he; "did she mention me?&mdash;and
often spoke about me&mdash;often? Then she's no forgotten
me a'thegither!"</p>

<p>He thrust a bank-note into the hands of Mrs Holditch,
which she refused to accept, saying that "the dear lady had
more than paid her for all that she had done already." But,
while she spoke, they had arrived within sight of the
cottage, and he suddenly bounded forward, exclaiming&mdash;"Oh!
haud my heart!" as he beheld Helen, sitting looking
from the window&mdash;"yonder she is! yonder she is! O
Helen! Helen!" he cried, rushing towards the door&mdash;"wherefore
did ye leave me?&mdash;why hae ye forsaken me?
But, joy o' my heart, I winna upbraid ye; for I hae found
ye again."</p>

<p>With an agitated step, she advanced to meet him&mdash;she
extended her hand towards him&mdash;she faltered&mdash;"My kind,
kind benefactor."</p>

<p>He heard the words she uttered&mdash;with a glance he beheld
the marriage-ring upon her finger&mdash;he stood still in the
midst of his transport&mdash;his outstretched arms fell motionless
by his side&mdash;"O Helen, woman!" he cried in agony,
"do ye really say <i>benefactor</i>?&mdash;that isna the word I wish to
hear frae ye. Ye never ca'ed me <i>benefactor</i> before!"</p>

<p>The few words spoken by the old woman had called up
his buried hopes; but the word <i>benefactor</i> had again whelmed
him in despair.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he continued, dashing away the tears from his
eyes, "my poor mind is flung away upon a whirlwind, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
my brain is the sport o' every shadow! O Helen! I thought
ye had forgotten me!"</p>

<p>"Forgotten you, my kind dear friend!" said she; "I
have not, I will not, I cannot forget you; and wherefore
would you forget that I can only remember you as a friend?"</p>

<p>"Poor, miserable, and deluded being that I am," added
he; "I expected, from what the mistress o' this house told
me, that I wouldna be welcomed by the cauldrife names o'
<i>friend</i> or <i>benefactor</i>. Do ye mind since ye used to call me
<i>Thomas</i>?"</p>

<p>"Mr Howison," answered she, "I know this visit has
been made in kindness&mdash;let me believe in parental anxiety.
You have not now to learn that I am a wife, and you can
have heard nothing here to lead you to think otherwise.
I will not pretend to misunderstand your language. But
by what name can I call you save that of friend?&mdash;it
was the first and the only one by which I have ever known
you."</p>

<p>"No, Helen," cried he, wringing her hand; "there was
a time when ye only said <i>Thomas!</i> and the sound o' that ae
word frae yer lips was a waff o' music, which echoed, like
the vibrations o' an angel's harp, about my heart for hours
and for hours!"</p>

<p>"If," added she, "from having been taught by you to
call you by that name in childhood, when I regarded you
as my guardian, and you condescended to be my playmate,
will you upbraid me with ceasing to use it now, when respect
to you and to myself demand the use of another? Or
can you, by any act of mine, place another meaning upon
my having used it, than obedience to your wishes, and the
familiarity of a thoughtless girl? And, knowing this, is it
possible that the best of men will heap sorrow upon sorrow
on the head of a friendless and afflicted woman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dinna say friendless, Helen," cried he; "friendless
ye canna be while I am in existence. Ye hae torn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
scales from my eyes, and the first use o' sicht has been to
show me that the past has been delusion, and that the future
is misery, solitary madness, or despair! And hae I really
a' this time mistaen sweetness for love, and familiarity for
affection? Do ye really say that it was only familiarity,
Helen?"</p>

<p>"The feelings of a sister for a brother," she answered;
"of a daughter for a father."</p>

<p>"True," said he; "I see it now; I was, indeed, older than
your father&mdash;I didna recollect that."</p>

<p>He sat thoughtful for a few minutes, when Helen, to
change the subject, inquired after her old nurse, Janet
White.</p>

<p>"Poor body," said he, raising his head, "her spirits are
clean gone. I understand she sits mourning for you by the
fire, cowering thegither like a pigeon that's lost its mate, or
a ewe whose lamb has been struck dead by its side. It
would wring tears from a heart o' stane to hear her lamenting,
morning, noon, and night, for her 'dear bairn,' as she
aye ca'ed ye&mdash;rocking her head and chirming owre her sorrow,
like a hen bird owre its rifled nest. I had her owre
at the Hall the day after I cam back frae London, and just
afore I cam here to seek for ye. But there is naething
aboot it that she taks delight in noo. And, when I strove
to amuse her, by taking her through the garden and plantations,
(though I stood mair in need o' comfort mysel'), she
would stand still and lean her head against a tree, in the
very middle o' some o' the bonniest spots, while a tear came
rowing down her cheeks, and look in my face wi' such a
sorrowfu' expression, that a thousand arrows, entering my
breast at ance, couldna hae caused me mair agony. I felt
that I was a puir, solitary, and despised being, only cast
into the midst o' a paradise, that my comfortless bosom
might appear the blacker and the more dismal. The puir
auld body saw what was passing within me, and she shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
her head, saying, 'Oh, sir! had I seen ye leading my bairn
down thir bonny avenues as your wife, Janet White would
have been a happy woman.' Then she wrung her withered
hands, and the tears hailed down her cheeks faster and faster;
while I hadna a word o' consolation to say to her, had it
been to save my life. For the very chirping o' the birds
grew irksome, and the young leaves and the silky flowers
painful to look upon. O Helen! if ye only kenned what
we a' suffer on yer account! If ye only kenned what it is
to have hope spired up, and affection preying upon your
ain heart for nourishment, ye wadna be angry at onything
I say."</p>

<p>"Think not it is possible," she replied, while her tears
flowed faster than her words; "but wherefore feed a hopeless
passion, the indulgence of which is now criminal?"</p>

<p>"Oh! forgie ye!" he exclaimed, vehemently; "dinna say
that, Helen! Hopeless it may be, but not <i>criminal</i>! That
is the only cruel word I ever heard frae yer lips! I didna
think onybody would hae said that to me! Did you really
say <i>criminal</i>? But, oh! as matters stand, if ye'd only alloo
me to say anither word or twa anent the subject, and if ye
wadna just crush me as a moth, and tak pleasure in my
agonies&mdash;or hae me to perish wi' the sunless desolation o'
my ain breast&mdash;ye'll alloo me to say them. They relate to
my last consolation&mdash;the last tie that links me and the
world together!"</p>

<p>"Speak," said Helen; "let not me be the cause of misery
I can have power to prevent."</p>

<p>"Oh, then!" replied he, "be not angry at what I'm going
to say; and mind, that, on your answer depends the future
happiness or misery o' a fellow-being. Yes, Helen! upon
your word depends life and hope&mdash;madness and misery; I
say life and hope&mdash;for, if ye destroy the one, the other winna
hand lang oot; and I say madness&mdash;for, oh! if ye had been
a witness o' the wild and the melancholy days and nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that I hae passed since I learned that ye had left me, and
felt my heart burning and beating, and my brain loup, louping
for ever, like a living substance, and shooting and stinging
through my head, like stings o' fire, till I neither kenned
whar I was, nor what I did; but stood still, or rushed out
in agony, and screamed to the wind, or gripped at the echo
o' my voice!&mdash;I say, if ye had seen this, ye wadna think it
strange that I made use o' the words. And, now, as ye
have heard nothing from&mdash;&mdash;from Henry Blackett, from the
night that the ceremony o' marriage was performed&mdash;and if
ye should hear nothing o' him for seven years to come, ye
will then, ye ken, be at liberty&mdash;and will ye say that I may
hope, then? O Helen, woman! say but the word, and I'll
wait the seven years, as Jacob did for Rachel, and count
them but a day if my Helen will bless me wi' a smile o'
hope!"</p>

<p>As he thus spoke, Mrs Holditch bustled into the room,
exclaiming&mdash;"O sweet lady, here be one coming thee knows&mdash;see!
see! there be my husband, and our own dear young
master Henry, come to make us happy again!"</p>

<p>"My Henry!" exclaimed Helen, springing towards the
door&mdash;"where&mdash;oh, where?".</p>

<p>"Here, my beloved! here!" replied Henry, meeting her
on the threshold.</p>

<p>Poor Laird Howison stood dumb, his mouth open, his
eyes extended, staring on vacancy. He beheld the object
of his delirious love sink into her husband's arms, and saw
no more. He clasped his hands together, and, with a deep
groan, reeled against the wall. Henry and Helen, in the
ecstasy of meeting each other, were unconscious of all
around, and Willie Galloway was the first to observe his
countryman.</p>

<p>"Preserve us! you here, too, Mr Howison!" said he. But
the features of the laird remained rivetted in agony, and
betrayed no symptom of recognition. The mention of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
laird's name by Willie, arrested the attention of Henry, and
approaching him, he said&mdash;"Sir, to you I ought to offer an
apology."</p>

<p>The unhappy man wildly grasped the hand of Henry, and
seizing also Helen's, he exclaimed&mdash;"It is a' owre now!
The chain is forged, and the iron is round my soul. But I
bless you baith. Tak her! tak her!&mdash;and hear me, Henry
Blackett&mdash;as ye would escape wrath and judgment, be kind
to her as the westlin' winds and the morning dews to the
leaves o' spring. Let it be your part to clothe her countenance
wi' smiles and her bosom wi' joy! Fareweel,
Helen!&mdash;look up!&mdash;let me, for the last time, look upon
your face, and I will carry that look upon my memory to
the grave!"</p>

<p>She gazed upon him wildly, crying&mdash;"Stay!&mdash;stay!&mdash;you
must not leave us!"</p>

<p>"Now!&mdash;now, it is past!" he cried; "it was a sair
struggle, but reason mastered it! Fareweel, Helen!&mdash;fareweel!"</p>

<p>Thus saying, he rushed out of the house, and Willie Galloway
followed him; but, although fleet of foot, he was
compelled to give up the pursuit.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the abrupt and wild departure of
the laird, and before Helen had recovered from the shock,
the ruffians, who, at the instigation of Norton, had hunted
after Henry to deliver him up to the government, and from
whom he had already twice escaped, rushed into the room,
exclaiming&mdash;"Secure the traitor!"</p>

<p>Henry sprang back to defend himself, and Willie Galloway,
who had returned, threw himself into a pugilistic
attitude. But Helen, stepping between her husband and
his pursuers, drew a paper from her bosom, and placing it
in his hands, said&mdash;"My Henry is free! he is pardoned!&mdash;the
king hath signed it!&mdash;laugh at the bloodhounds!" And,
as she spoke, she sank upon his breast. He opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
paper; it was his pardon under the royal signature and
the royal seal! "My own!&mdash;my wife!&mdash;my wife!" cried
Henry, pressing her to his heart, and weeping on her neck.</p>

<p>"That crowns a'!" exclaimed Willie Galloway; "O
Helen!&mdash;what a lassie ye are!"</p>

<p>The ruffians slunk from the room in confusion, and Willie
informed them that the sooner they were out of sight it
would be the better for them.</p>

<p>Helen, on leaving Scotland, had proceeded to London,
where, through the interest of a friend of Laird Howison's,
she gained access to the Duke of Cumberland, and throwing
herself at his feet, had, through him, obtained her husband's
pardon, and that pardon she had carried next her bosom
to his father's house, hoping to find him there.</p>



<p><br /><br />Having divided this tale into chapters, we now come to
the</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p>Henry being now pardoned, Willie Galloway advised that
he should take his wife to his father's house, and remain
there, adding&mdash;"Mind ye, Maister Henry, that possession
is nine points o' law&mdash;and if ye be in want o' the matter o'
five hundred pounds for present use, or for mair to prove
your birthright at law, I am the man that will advance
it, and that will leave no stone unturned till I see you
righted."</p>

<p>Willie's suggestion was acted upon; and Henry and
Helen took up their abode in the Priory, where they had
been but a few weeks, when he obtained information that
his father had fallen in a duel, and that his adversary was
none other than Squire Norton, the father of his then wife;
but with his dying breath he declared, in the presence of
his seconds, and invoked them to record it, that his injured
son Henry was his only and lawful heir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"That," exclaimed Norton, with a savage laugh over his
dying antagonist, "it will cost him some trouble to prove!"</p>

<p>The murderer, in the name of a child which his daughter
had borne to Sir John, had the hardihood to enter legal
proceedings to obtain the estate.</p>

<p>Henry applied to the parish of Glencleugh for the register
of his mother's marriage; but no such record was found.
Old Dugald Mackay had a dreamy recollection of such a
marriage taking place; but he said&mdash;"It pe very strange
that it isna in te pook; hur canna swear to it."</p>

<p>Many thought that the day would be given against Henry,
and pitied him; but before judgment was pronounced in
the case, young Norton was found guilty of forgery, and
condemned to undergo the just severity of the law. Previous
to his ignominious death, in the presence of witnesses,
he confessed the injury he had done to Henry by tearing
the leaves from the parish register, and directed where they
might be found. They were found&mdash;old Norton fled from
the country, and Henry obtained undisputed possession of
the estate; but on his father's widow and child he settled
a competency.</p>

<p>Laird Howison's sorrow moderated as his years increased;
and when Henry and Helen had children, and when they
had grown up to run about, he requested that they should
be sent to him every year, to pull the primroses around
Primrose Hall; and they were sent. One of them, a girl,
the image of her mother, he often wept over, and said, he
hoped to live to love her, as he had loved her mother. Willie
Galloway often visited his friends in Cheshire, and remained
"canny Willie" to the end of the chapter.</p>

<h2>THE BRIDE OF BRAMBLEHAUGH.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>It has been stated by the greatest critics the world ever
saw&mdash;whose names we would mention, if we did not wish
to avoid interfering with the simplicity of our humble annals&mdash;that
no fictitious character ought to be made at once
virtuous and unfortunate; and the reason given for it is
that mankind, having a natural tendency to a belief of an
adjustment, even in this world, of the claims of virtue and
the deserts of vice, are displeased with a representation
which at once overturns this belief, and creates dissatisfaction
with the ways of Providence. This may be very good
criticism, and we have no wish to find fault with it as
applied to works intended to produce a certain effect on the
minds of readers; but, so long as Nature and Providence
work with machinery whose secret springs are hid from our
view, and evince&mdash;doubtless for wise purposes&mdash;a disregard
of the adjustment of rewards and punishments for virtue
and vice, we shall not want a higher authority than critics
for exhibiting things as they are, and portraying on the page
of truth, wet with unavailing tears, goodness that went to
the grave, not only unrewarded, but struck down with
griefs that should have dried the heart and grizzled the hairs
of the wicked.</p>

<p>In a little haugh that runs parallel to the Tweed&mdash;at a
part of its course not far from Peebles, and through which
there creeps, over a bed of white pebbles, a little burn, whose
voice is so small, except at certain places where a larger
stone raises its "sweet anger" to the height of a tiny</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>"buller," that the lowest note of the goldfinch drowns it
and charms it to silence&mdash;there stood, about the middle of
the last century, a cottage. Its white walls and dark roof,
with some white roses and honeysuckle flowering on its
walls, bespoke the humble retreat of contentment and
comfort. The place went by the name of Bramblehaugh,
from the sides of the small burn being lined, for several miles,
with the bramble. The sloping collateral ground was
covered with shrubs and trees of various kinds, which
harboured, in the summer months, a great collection of
birds&mdash;the blackbird, the starling, the mavis, and others of
the tuneful choir&mdash;whose notes rendered harmonious the
secluded scene where they sang unmolested. The spot is
one of those which, scattered sparingly over a wild country,
woo the footsteps of lovers of nature, and, by a few months
of their simple charms, regenerate the health, while they
quicken and gratify the business-clouded fancies of the
denizens of smoky towns.</p>

<p>The cottage we have now described was occupied by
David Mearns, and his wife Elizabeth, called, by our national
contraction, Betty. These individuals earned a livelihood,
and nothing more, by the mode in which poor cotters in
Scotland contrive to spin out an existence; the leading feature
of which, contentment, the result of necessity, is often
falsely denominated happiness by those whose positive pleasures,
chequered by a few misfortunes, are forgotten in the
contemplation of a state of life almost entirely negative.
Difficulties that cannot be overcome deaden the energies
that have in vain been exerted to surmount them; and,
when all efforts to better our condition are relinquished, we
acquire a credit for contentedness, which is only a forced
adaptation of limited means to an unchangeable end. David
Mearns, who had, in his younger days, been ruined by a high
farm, had learned from misfortune what he would not have
been very apt to have received from the much-applauded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
philosophy which is said to generate a disposition to be
pleased with our lot. The bitterness of disappointment, and
the wish to get beyond the reach of obligations he could not
discharge, suggested the remedy of a reliance simply on his
capability of earning a cotter's subsistence; and having
procured a cheap lease of the little domicile of Bramblehaugh,
he set himself down, with the partner of his hopes
and misfortunes, to eat, with that simulated contentment
we have noticed, the food of his hard labour, with the relish
of health, and to extract from the lot thus forced upon him
as much happiness as it would yield. The cottage and the
small piece of ground attached to it, was the property of an
old man, who, having made a great deal of money by the
very means that had failed in the hands of David Mearns,
had purchased the property of Burnbank, lying on the side
of the small rivulet already mentioned, and, in consequence,
it was said, of Betty Mearns bearing the same name,
(Cherrytrees,) though there was no relationship between
them, had let to David the small premises at a low rent.</p>

<p>A single child had blessed the marriage of David Mearns
and his wife&mdash;a daughter, called Euphemia, though generally,
for the sake of brevity and kindliness, called Effie;
an interesting girl, who, at the period we speak of, had arrived
at the age of sixteen years. In a place where there
were few to raise the rude standard of beauty formed in the
minds of a limited country population, she was accounted
"bonny"&mdash;a much&mdash;abused word, no doubt, in Scotland, but
yet having a very fair and legitimate application to an interesting
young creature, whose blue eyes, however little real
town beauty they may have expressed or illuminated, gave
out much tenderness and feeling, accompanied by that inexpressible
look of pure, unaffected modesty, which is the first,
but the most difficult gesture of the female manner attempted
to be imitated by those who are destitute of the feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that produces it. An expression of pensiveness&mdash;perhaps
the fruit of the early misfortunes of her parents operating
on the tender mind of infancy, ever quick in catching, with
instinctive sympathy, the feeling that saddens or enlivens
the spirits of a mother&mdash;was seldom abroad from her countenance,
imparting to it a deep interest, and, by suggesting
a wish to relieve the cause of so early an indication of incipient
melancholy, creating an instant friendship, which subsequent
intercourse did not diminish.</p>

<p>Walter Cherrytrees, the Laird of Burnbank, a man approaching
seventy years of age, had a daughter, Lucy, about
the same age as Effie Mearns. He had lost his wife about
fifteen years before; and&mdash;though a feeling of anxiousness
often found its way to his heart, suggesting to his vacant
mind, as the cure of his listlessness and the balm of his bereavement,
another wife&mdash;he had for a long time been nearly
equally poised between the hope of Lucy becoming his comfort
in his old age, and the wish for a tender partner of pleasures
which, without participation, lose their relish. His
daughter, Lucy, was a sprightly, showy girl, who, having got
a good education, might, with the prospect she had of inheriting
her father's property, have been entitled to look for
a husband among the sons of the neighbouring proprietors,
if her father's secluded mode of life, and plain, blunt manners,
had not to a great extent limited her intercourse to a
few acquaintances, by no means equal to him in point of
wealth or status, however estimable they might have been
in other respects. A more pleasant companion to the old
Laird of Burnbank could not be found, from the one end of
Bramblehaugh to the other, than David Mearns, his tenant,
whose honesty and bluntness, set off by a fertility of simple
anecdote, had charms for one of the same habits of thought
and feeling, which all the disadvantages of his poverty could
not counterbalance. The intimacy of the fathers produced,
at a very early period, a friendship between the daughters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
who, notwithstanding, could not boast of the resemblance of
thought and manners, and community of feeling, which
formed the foundation of the attachment existing between
the parents.</p>

<p>This friendship was not exclusive of some acquaintanceships
with the neighbouring young men and women, which,
however, were in general mutual; neither of the two young
maidens having formed any intimacy with another without,
her friend participating in the friendship. Among others,
Lewis Campbell, the son of a neighbouring farmer, who had
been a large creditor of David Mearns at the time of his
failure, called sometimes at the cottage of Bramblehaugh,
and was soon smitten with a strong love for Effie. They
sometimes indulged in long walks by the side of the river.</p>

<p>We may anticipate, when we say that the hours spent in
these excursions&mdash;in which the greatest beauties of external
nature, and the strongest and purest emotions of two loving
hearts, acting in co-operation and harmony, formed a present
and a future such as poets dream of, and the world
never realizes, but in momentary glimpses&mdash;were the happiest
of these lovers. Effie's inseparable companion, Lucy,
frequently met them as they sauntered along by the house
of Burnbank; and the soft breathings of ardent affection
were relieved by the gay and innocent prattle of the companions,
who enjoyed, though in different degrees, the conversation
and manners of the young lover. The simplicity
and single-heartedness of Effie were entirely exclusive of a
single thought unfavourable to an equal openness and
frankness on the part of her companion, whom she had informed,
in her artless way, of the state of her affections.
But what might not have resulted from a mere acquaintanceship
between Lucy and Effie's lover, was called forth
by the pride of the former, whose spirit of emulation, excited
by the good fortune of her poor friend, suggested a
secret wish to alienate the affections of Lewis from her companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and direct them to herself. The wish to be beloved,
though the mere effect of emulation, is the surest of the artificial
modes by which love itself is generated in the heart
of the wisher; and Lucy soon became, unknown for a
time to Effie, as much enamoured of young Lewis as was
her unsuspecting friend.</p>

<p>The first intimation that Effie received of the state of
Lucy's feelings towards her lover, was from Lewis himself.
Sitting at a part of the haugh called the Cross Knowe, from
the circumstance of an old Romish cruciform stone that
stood on the top of a gentle elevation&mdash;a place much resorted
to by the lovers&mdash;Lewis, unable to conceal a single thought
or feeling from one who so well deserved his confidence, first
told her of the perfidy of her friend.</p>

<p>"You are not so well supplied with sweethearts, Effie,"
he began, "as I am; for I can boast of two besides
you."</p>

<p>"That speaks little in your favour, Lewie," replied she;
"for, if it was my wish, I could hae a' the young men o'
the haugh makin love to me frae mornin to e'en."</p>

<p>"That remark, Effie," said Lewis, "implies that I have
courted, or at least received marks of affection, from others
besides you, while I was leading you to suppose that my
heart was entirely yours. Now, that is not justified by what
I said; for one may have sweethearts, and neither know
nor acknowledge them as such."</p>

<p>"Maybe I am wrang, Lewie," said Effie; "but what was
I to think but that the twa ither sweethearts ye mentioned
were acknowledged by ye? It's no in the pooer o' my puir
heart to conceive how a young woman could love are that
neither kenned nor acknowledged her love. But I speak
frae my ain simple, an' maybe worthless thoughts. The
world's wide, an' haulds black an' fair, weak an' strong,
heigh and laigh; an' wharfore no also hearts an' minds as
different as their bodies? The birds o' this haugh hae only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
their ain single luves; but they're a' coloured alike that belang
to ae kind. Would that it had been God's pleasure to
mak mankind like thae bonny birds!"</p>

<p>"I fear, Effie," replied Lewis, "that a statement of mine,
intended to be partly in jest, has been construed by you in
such a manner as to produce to you pain. God is my witness
that I am as single-hearted in my affection as the birds
of this haugh; and gaudier colours, sweeter notes, and
better scented bowers will never interfere with the love I bear
to Effie Mearns."</p>

<p>"What meant ye, then, Lewie, by sayin ye had twa
sweethearts besides Effie Mearns?" said she.</p>

<p>"That you shall immediately know," replied Lewis
"and you will think more highly of me when I shew you,
by my revealing secrets, not indeed confided to me, but still
secrets, that you have all my heart and the thoughts that it
contains. The first of my other lovers you will not be jealous
of, for she is old Lizzy Buchanan, or, as she calls herself,
Buwhanan, my nurse, who loves me as well as you do,
Effie; but the other, I fear, may create in you an unpleasant
feeling of confidence misplaced, and friendship repaid
by something like treachery. Surely I need say no more."</p>

<p>"Is it indeed sae, Lewie?" said she. "It's lang sin I
whispered&mdash;and my heart beat and my limbs trembled as I
did it&mdash;in the ear o' Lucy Cherrytrees, that my puir, silly
thoughts were never aff Lewie Campbell. And what think
ye she said to me? She said I needna look far ayont
Bramblehaugh for a bonnier and a brawer lover."</p>

<p>"Then," replied Lewis, "I am not much better off than
you are; for she told me that your simplicity, she feared,
was art, and that your poverty made any beauty you
had; and she doubted if that bonny face was not a great
snare for the ruin of a penniless lover."</p>

<p>"Sae, sae," said she, sighing deeply; "and has the fair
face o' life's friendship put on the looks o' the hypocrite at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the very time when greater confidence was required? I
hae read in Laird Cherrytrees' books he is sae kind as lend
me, many an example o' fause and faithless creatures, baith
men and women, o' the world, o' the great cities that lie
far ayont oor humble sphere; but little did I think that
here in Bramblehaugh, where our bughts ken nae nicht-thieves,
and our hen-roosts nae reynards, there was ane, and
that ane my friend, wha could smile in my face at the very
moment she was tryin to ruin me in the eyes o' ane wha is
dearest to me on earth."</p>

<p>As she thus poured forth her feelings with greater loquacity
than she generally exhibited&mdash;being for the most
part quiet and gentle&mdash;the tears flowed down her cheeks
in great profusion, and she sobbed bitterly, in spite of
all the efforts of Lewis to satisfy her that Lucy's endeavours
to lessen her in his estimation were entirely fruitless.</p>

<p>"Apprehend nothing, dear Effie, from the discovered
treachery of a false friend," said he, as he pressed her
to his bosom. "It has less power with me than the
whispers of that gentle burn have on the sleeping echoes
of the Eagle's Rock that only answers to the voice of
the tempest."</p>

<p>"It's no that, Lewie," replied she, wiping away her tears,
"that gies me pain. I hae nae fear o' faith and troth
that has been pledged, and better than pledged; for I
hae seen it i' yer looks, and heard it i' the soonds o'
yer deep-drawn sighs. Thae tears are for a broken friendship&mdash;for
the return o' evil for guid&mdash;for the withered
blossoms o' a bonny flower I hae cherished and watered, in
the hope it wad yield me a sweet smell when I kissed
its leaves i' the daffin o' youth or the kindliness o' age. If
it is sae sair to lose a friend, what, Lewie&mdash;what wad
it be to lose a lover?"</p>

<p>"The very existence of great evils, Effie," said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
"makes us happy, in the thought that they are beyond our
reach."</p>

<p>"But did I no think," said she, "that I was beyond
the reach o' the pain o' experiencing the fauseness o'
Lucy Cherrytrees&mdash;the very creature o' a' ithers, I hae
chosen as my bosom friend&mdash;to whom I confided a' my
thochts and the very secret o' my love?"</p>

<p>"But it is an ill wind that blaws naebody guid, as they
say, Effie," said Lewis. "I can better appreciate your goodness,
now that I have experienced the faithlessness of
another."</p>

<p>"An' if I hae lost a friend," replied Effie, "I am the
mair sure o' my lover. Ye dinna ken, Lewie, how muckle
this has raised you even in my mind, whar ye hae aye occupied
the highest place. Ye hae rejected the offered luve
o' the braw heiress o' Burnbank, for the humble dochter o'
David Mearns, wha earns his bread in the sweat o' his brow.
Oh! what can a puir, penniless cottager's dochter gie in return
to the man wha, for her sake, turns his back on a big
ha', a thoosand braid acres, an' a braw heiress?"</p>

<p>"Her simple, genuine, unsophisticated heart," replied
Lewis, "with one unchangeable, devoted affection beating
in its core. Were Burnbank Hall as big as the Parliament
House, and Burnbank itself longer than the lands watered
by the Brambleburn, and Lucy Cherrytrees as fair as our
unfortunate Mary Stuart, I would not give my simple
Effie, with no more property of her own than the bandeau
that binds her fair locks, for Lucy Cherrytrees and all her
lands."</p>

<p>The two lovers continued their evening walks, indulging
in conversations which, embracing the subject of their affection,
and anticipating the pleasures of their ultimate union,
realized that fullest enjoyment of hope which is said to
transcend possession. No notice was taken of their mutual
sentiments on the subject of Lucy Cherrytrees' affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
for Lewis, and her unjustifiable attempts to displace her old
friend, to make room for herself in the heart of the contested
object of their wishes.</p>

<p>Matters continued in this state for some time, Effie being
regularly gratified by a visit from Lewis three times a-week.
On one occasion a whole week passed without any intelligence
of her lover. Her inquiries had produced no satisfactory
explanation of the unusual occurrence; and Fancy,
under the spell of the genius of Fear, was busy in her
vocation of drawing dark pictures of coming evil. At last
she was told by her father, who had procured the intelligence
from a friend of George Campbell, the father, that
young Lewis had been suspected of an intention to marry
the poor daughter of the cottager, David Mearns, and had
been despatched, without a minute's premonition, 'to an
uncle, who was a merchant in Rio de Janeiro. No time had
been given to him to write to Effie; and care had been
taken to prevent him from sending her any intelligence
while he remained at Liverpool, previous to his departure.
The statement was corroborated by intelligence to the same
effect, procured by one of Laird Cherrytrees' servants from
one of the servants of George Campbell, who told it to Lucy,
and who again told it to Effie, with tears in her eyes, which
she took every care to conceal. The effect produced on the
mind of Effie Mearns, by this unexpected misfortune, was
proportioned to its magnitude, and the susceptibility of the
feelings of the delicate individual on whom it operated. For
many days she wept incessantly, refusing the ordinary sustenance
of a life which she now deemed of no importance to herself
or to any one else. All attempts at comforting a
bruised heart were&mdash;as they generally are in cases of
disappointed love&mdash;unavailing; and the effects of time
seemed only apparent in a quieter, though not in any
degree less poignant sorrow. Every object kept alive the
remembrance of the youth who had first made an impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
on her heart, and whose image was graven on every spot of
the neighbourhood which had been consecrated by the exchange
of a mutual passion. The scenes of their wanderings,
hallowed as they had been in her memory, were now
peopled with undefined terrors; and every time that she was
forced abroad to take that air and exercise which latterly
seemed indispensable to her existence, her sorrow received
an accession of power from every tree under which they
had sat, and every knowe or dell where they had listened
to the musical loves of the birds, as they exchanged their
own in not less eloquent sighs.</p>

<p>The first circumstance that produced any effect on the
mind of the disconsolate maiden, was a misfortune of another
kind, which, realizing the old adage, seemed to follow with
all due rapidity the footsteps of its precursor. Her mother,
who sat on one side of the fire, while Effie occupied her
usual seat in a corner of the cottage in the other, had been
using all the force of her rude but impressive eloquence to
get her daughter to adopt the means that were in her
power for the amelioration of a grief which might render
her childless.</p>

<p>"I am gettin auld, Effie," she said, "an' you are the
only are I can look to for administerin to yer faither an' to
me that comfort we hae a richt to expect at the hands o' a
dochter wha never yet was deficient in her duty. Our
poverty, which winna be made ony less severe, as ye may
weel ken, by the income o' years, will mak yer attention to
us mair necessary; an' it may even be&mdash;God meise the
means!&mdash;that your weak hands may yet be required to
work for the support o' yer auld parents. I hae lang intended
to speak to you in this way, and it was only pity for
my puir heart-broken Effie that put me aff frae day to day,
in the expectation that either some news wad come frae
Lewie, or that ye wad get consolation frae anither and a
higher source, to support ye for trials ye may yet hae to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
bear up against, for the sake o' them that brocht ye into the
world. A' ither means hae been tried to get ye to determine
to live, an' no lay yersel doun to dee, an' they havin
failed, what can I do but try the last remedy in my pooer&mdash;to
speak, as I hae now dune, to yer guid sense, an' lay afore
ye the duties o' a dutifu' bairn, which are far aboon the
thochts o' a disappointed love. Promise, now, my bonny
Effie, that ye will try to gie up yer mournin, for the
sake o' parents whase love for ye is nae less than Lewie
Campbell's."</p>

<p>As Betty finished her impressive admonition to Effie, who
acknowledged its force, and inwardly determined on complying
with the request of her mother, an unusual noise at
the door of the cottage startled her anxious ear. It seemed
that a number of people were approaching the cottage,
and the groans of one in deep distress and pain were mixed
with the low talk of the crowd, who, from those inexpressible
indications which the ear can catch and analyse ere
the mind is conscious of the operation, seemed already to
sympathise with one to whom they were bearing a grief.
Housed by that anticipative fear of evil which all unfortunate
people feel, Betty ran to the door, followed by her
daughter, and opened it&mdash;to let in the mangled body of her
husband; who, in felling an oak, on the property of Burnbank,
had fallen under the weight of the tree, and got his
leg broken, and one of his arms dislocated at the shoulder-joint.
He was conveyed, by the kind neighbours, to a bed;
and, by the time they got him undressed, for the purpose of
his wounds being submitted to the curative process of the
doctor, that individual arrived, and proceeded to perform
the painful operation of setting the broken bones. The full
effect of this misfortune to Effie and her mother was for a
time suspended by the call made upon them to relieve the
sufferings of the father and husband; and it was not till the
bustle ceased, and the neighbours (excepting two women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
whose services, in addition to those of the wife and
daughter, might still be required) went away, that they felt
the full force of the gigantic evil that had befallen them, the
consequences of which might extend through the remaining
years of their existence.</p>

<p>A period of no less than eighteen months passed away,
and David Mearns was still unable to do more than, with
assistance, to rise from his bed, and sit, during a part of the
day, by the fire, or at the window. During the whole of
this time, he had been tended by his daughter with assiduous
care. Her filial sympathies, called into active operation
by the sorrows of her parent, filled up the void that
had been made in her heart by the departure of her lover;
and a new source of grief effected (however paradoxical it
may seem) a change in the morbid melancholy to which she
had been enslaved, which, although not for mental health or
ease, was so much in favour of exertion and remedial exercise,
that she came to present the appearance of one inclined
to endeavour to sustain her sorrow, rather than resign
herself to the fatal power of an irremediable woe. Among
the visitors who took an interest in a family reduced
by one stroke to want and all its attendant evils, Laird
Cherrytrees evinced the strongest concern for the fate of
his friend; and, by a timeous contribution of necessary assistance,
ameliorated, in so far as man could, the unhappy
condition of virtue under the load of misery. The many
visits of the good old laird, and the long periods of time he
passed by the bedside of the patient, enabled him to see and
appreciate the devoted attention of Effie to her parent; and
often, as she flew at the slightest indication of a wish for
something to assuage pain, or remove the uneasiness produced
by the long confinement, he would stop the current
of his narrative, and fix his eyes on the kind maiden, so
long as her tender office engaged her attention and feelings
These long looks, not unaccompanied at times with a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sigh, were attributed, as they well might, to admiration and
approbation of so much filial affection and devotedness exercised
towards one whom the old laird respected above all his
friends.</p>

<p>The visits of Laird Cherrytrees were at first twice or
thrice a-week. His infirm body already begun to exhibit
the effects of old age, prevented him from walking; and such
was the anxiety he felt for the unhappy patient, that he
mounted his old pony, Donald, nearly as frail as his master,
to enable him to administer consolation so much required.
He came always at the same hour; Effie, who expected him,
was often at the door ready to receive him; and, while she
held old Donald's head till he dismounted, welcomed her
father's friend with so much sincerity and pleasure, that if
she had failed in her ostlership, he would have felt a disappointment
he would not have liked to express. Even when
at a distance from the cottage, he strained his eyes to endeavour
to catch a glimpse of the faithful attendant; and,
if he did not see her, the rein of Donald was relaxed, and
he was allowed to saunter along at his own pleasure, or even
to eat grass by the roadside, (a luxury he delighted in from
his having once belonged to a cadger,) so as to give Effie
time to get to her post.</p>

<p>The three days of the week on which Laird Cherrytrees
was in the habit of visiting David Mearns, were Monday,
Thursday, and Saturday; and he seldom came without
bringing something to the poor family&mdash;either some money
for old Betty; some preserves, prepared by Lucy, for the
invalid; or a book, or a flower from Burnbank garden, for
Effie. When his conversation with David was finished&mdash;and
every day it seemed to get shorter and shorter, though
there seemed no lack of either subjects or ideas&mdash;he commenced
to talk with Effie, chiefly on the nature and contents
of the books he brought her to read; and nothing seemed
to delight him more than to sit in the large arm-chair by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
David's bedside, and hear Effie discoursing, <i>ex cathedra</i>, (on
a three-footed stool at the foot of the bed, opposite to the
Laird's chair,) with her characteristic simplicity and good
sense, on the subjects he himself had suggested. But, notwithstanding
all her efforts to appear well-pleased in presence
of the man who was supporting her family, her train
of thoughts was often broken in upon by the recollections of
Lewis Campbell, and she would sit for an hour at a time,
with the eyes of the Laird fixed on her melancholy face, as
if he had been all that time in mute cogitation, suggesting
some remedy for her sorrow. His ideas and feelings seemed
to be operated upon by the same power that ruled the mind
of the maiden; for his face followed, in its changing
expressions, the mutations of her countenance. Her melancholy
seemed to be communicated by a glance of her
watery eye, as the thought of Lewis entered her mind; and
when she recovered from her gloomy reverie, a corresponding
indication of relief lighted up the grey, twinkling orbs
of the old Laird. This custom of "glowrin," for whole
hours at a time, on the face of the sensitive girl, at first
painful to her, became a matter of indifference; and the
position and attitudes of the three individuals&mdash;Betty being
generally engaged about the house&mdash;undergoing, while
the Laird was present, no change, came to assume something
like the natural properties of the parties, as if they
had been fixtures, or lay figures for the study of a painter.</p>

<p>Every time the Laird came to the cottage, he extended
the period of his stay, and, latterly, he did not stir till a
servant from Burnbank, sent by Lucy, came to take him
home. It seemed as if he could not get enough of
"glowrin;" for, latterly, all his occupation, which at first
consisted of rational conversation, merged in that mute eloquence
of the eye, or rather in that inebriation of the orb,
"drinking of light," which lovers of sights, especially
female countenances, are so fond of. The visits had been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
regular, not a day being ever missed, that, as Effie held the
stirrup till he mounted Donald, during all which time the
process of "glowrin" went on as regularly as at the bedside
of David, she never thought of asking, and he never thought
of stating, when he would call again. Time had stamped
the act of calling with the impress of unchangeable custom.
The caseless clock of David's cottage was not more regular;
the only change being that already observed&mdash;that the
time of the Laird's stay gradually and gradually lengthened.</p>

<p>The homage paid by Effie to Laird Cherrytrees was, as
may easily be conceived, the respect, attention, and kindness
of an open-hearted girl, filled with gratitude to the
preserver of the lives of her and her parents. Every evening
she offered up, at her bedside, prayers for the preservation
and happiness of the man but for whose kindness
starvation might have overtaken the helpless invalid, and
not much less helpless wife and daughter. In their prayers
the "amen" of David and his wife was the most heart-felt
expression of love and gratitude that ever came from
the lips of mortal. This feeling, however, did not prevent
David Mearns and Betty from sometimes indulging, in the
absence of Effie (in all likelihood giving freedom to her
tears, as she sat in some favourite retreat of her absent
lover,) in some remarks on the extraordinary conduct of
Laird Cherrytrees. They soon saw through the secret, and
resolved upon drawing him out; for which purpose Effie was
to be called away on the occasion of the next visit.</p>

<p>The Laird came as he used to do, took his seat, and resumed
his gazing. Effie pleased him exceedingly, by an
account she gave him of the last book he brought to her;
and, throwing himself back in the arm chair, he seemed, for
a time, wrapped in meditation. Effie obeyed, in the meantime,
her mother's request, to come for a few minutes to the
green to assist her in her work; and, when the Laird again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
applied his eyes to their accustomed vocation, he was surprised,
but not (for once) displeased, at her disappearance.
A great struggle now commenced between some wish and a
restraint. He looked round the cottage, and then turned
his eyes on David; acts which he repeated several times.
Incipient syllables of words half-formed died away in his
struggling throat. He moved restlessly in the large chair,
and twirled his silver-headed cane in his hand. He even
rose, went to the door, looked out, came back again, and
took his seat without saying a word. Holding away his
face from David, he at last made out a few words, uttered
with great difficulty.</p>

<p>"She's a fine lassie, Effie," he said.</p>

<p>"A bonnier an' a better never was brocht up in Bramblehaugh,
savin yer ain Lucy," replied David.</p>

<p>"Hoo auld is she noo?" said the Laird, still holding
away his face.</p>

<p>"She will be nineteen come the time," replied David.</p>

<p>"It's a pity she's sae young," rejoined the Laird, with a
great struggle, and making a noise with his cane, as if he had
repented of his words, and wished to drown them before they
reached the ears of David.</p>

<p>"I dinna think sae, beggin yer Honour's pardon," replied
David. "We need her assistance, in this trial; an' I'm
just thinkin o' some way she micht use her hands&mdash;an she's
willing aneugh, puir cratur&mdash;for our assistance."</p>

<p>"Are ye no pleased wi' my assistance?" said the Laird,
displeased at something in David's reply.</p>

<p>"Yer Honour has saved our lives," replied David, feelingly,
"an' it wad only be because we are ashamed o
yer guidness that we wad wish our dochter to tak a part
o' that burden aff ane wha is under nae obligation to serve
us."</p>

<p>"If I hae been yer friend, ye hae been mine," said the
Laird. "I hae got guid advices frae ye; an', even noo, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hae something to ask ye concernin mysel, that nae ither
man i' the haugh could sae weel answer."</p>

<p>"What is that, yer Honour?" said David.</p>

<p>"What do ye think, David Mearns, I should do," said
the Laird, moving about in the chair in evident perplexity,
"if my dochter Lucy were to tak a husband an' leave Burnbank?
I carena aboot fa'in into the hands o' Jenny
Mucklewham, wha, for this some time past, has neither
cleaned my buckles nor brushed my coat as I wad wish.
She says I'm mair fashious; but that's a mere excuse."</p>

<p>"I hae seen aulder men marry again," said David, thinking
he would please the Laird, by giving him such an answer
as he was clearly fishing for.</p>

<p>"Aulder men, David, man!" replied the Laird, looking
down at his person, and adjusting his wig. "Did I ask ye
onything aboot my age? I wanted merely your advice, what
I should do in certain circumstances, an' ye gie me a comparison
for an answer.&mdash;Do ye think I should marry?"</p>

<p>"If yer Honour has ony wish in that way, I think ye
should," said David.</p>

<p>"I never yet did wrang in following your advice, David
Mearns," said the Laird. "&mdash;She's a fine lassie, Effie."</p>

<p>"Ou, ay," responded David, at a loss what more to
say.</p>

<p>"Very fine," again said the Laird, turning his face
partially from the window, so as the tail of his eye
reached David's face, and waiting for something more.</p>

<p>David could, however, say nothing. The very circumstance
of the Laird's wishing him to say something pertinent
to the purpose already so broadly hinted at, prevented him
from touching so delicate a subject; and, notwithstanding
of another application of the tail of the Laird's eye, he was
silent.</p>

<p>"Ye hae gien me ae advice, David," said the Laird, in despair
of getting anything more out of David without a question:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
"could ye no tell me <i>wha</i> I should marry, man?"
And having achieved this announcement, he rose and walked
to the window.</p>

<p>"That's owre delicate a subject for me to gie an advice
on, yer Honour," replied David. "The doo lays aside
ninety-nine guid straes, an' taks the hundredth, though a
crooked ane, for its nest. Ye maun judge for yersel."</p>

<p>"What say ye to yer ain Effie, then?" said the Laird, relieved
at last from a dreadful burden.</p>

<p>"If yer Honour likes the lassie, an' she'll tak yer Honour,
I can hae nae objections," replied David.</p>

<p>The Laird, who seemed twenty years younger after this
declaration, took David by the hand, and shook it till the
pain of his dislocated arm almost made him cry.</p>

<p>"Will ye speak to her aboot it. David!" said he, still
holding his hand. "The best farm o' Burnbank will be
your reward. Plead for me, David, my best friend. Tell
Betty aboot it, and get her to use a mother's pooer. If I
can trust my een, Effie doesna dislike me. If a' gaes weel,
ye may hae Ravelrigg, or Braidacre, or Muirfield&mdash;onything
that's in my pooer to gie, David." And the old lover, exhausted
by the struggle and excitement he had suffered,
sank back into the chair.</p>

<p>"I will do my best," replied David. And the old Laird
sighed, and absolutely groaned with pure, unmixed satisfaction.</p>

<p>At the end of this scene, Effie and her mother came in.
The damsel took her old seat on the three-footed stool at the
foot of the bed; the eyes of the Laird sought again her face,
where he thought they had a better right now to rest. No
more was spoken; enough for a day had been said and done;
and, with a parting look to David, to keep him in remembrance
of his promise, and a purse of money slipped into the
hand of Betty, as a solvent of any obstacle that might exist
in her mind, the lover went to the door to receive Donald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
from the soft hands of Effie, who, as was her custom, had
gone out before him, to lead the old cadger to the door, and
hold the bridle till he with an effort got into the saddle.
The only difference Effie could observe in his departure
this day, was a kind of mock-gallant wave of the hand,
as he, with more than usual spirit, struck his spurless
heels into Donald's sides, and tried to rise in the saddle,
in response to the hobble of the old Highlander.</p>

<p>The Laird had been scarcely out of the house, when
David had a communing with his wife, in absence of Effie,
on the extraordinary intimation made by the old lover.
Betty was agreeable to the match; but the tear came into
her eye as she thought of the sacrifice poor Effie was to be
called upon to make. Neither of them could answer for the
consent of Effie, whose melancholy, though somewhat ameliorated,
was little diminished, and whose recollections of
Lewis Campbell were as vivid as they were on the day of his
departure. When she returned from one of her solitary
rambles, which fed her passion and increased her grief, she
was delicately told of the intentions of Laird Cherrytrees.
The announcement of the extraordinary intelligence produced
an effect which neither her father nor mother could
have anticipated. A quick operation of her mind placed
before her all the affectionate acts of attention she had for
years been in the habit of applying to the old friend of her
father, and the preserver of their lives. Gratitude, operating
in one of the most grateful hearts that ever beat in the
bosom of mortal, had produced in her an exuberant kindness,
a devotedness of a species of affection due by a child to
its godfather, a playful freedom of the confidence of one who
relied on the disparity of years for a license from even the
suspicion of a possibility of any other relation existing between
them. That now came back upon her, loaded with self-reproach
and shame, and attributing to her misconstrued
attentions the extraordinary passion that had taken hold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the heart of the old Laird. She was totally unable to make
any reply to her parents. The image of Lewis Campbell,
never absent from her mind, assumed a new form, and swam
in the tears which flowed from her eyes. The natural contrast
between age and youth, love and gratitude, assumed its
legitimate strength. The first feeling of her mind was, that
she would suffer the death that had for a time been impending
over her, and whose finger was already on her
breaking heart, rather than comply with the wishes of her
father and mother. They saw the struggle that was in her
mind, and abstained from pressing what they had suggested.
They did not ask her even to give her sentiments; but the
silent tears that stole down her cheek and dropped in her
lap from her drooping head, required no spoken commentary
to tell them the extent of her grief, and the resolution
at least of a heart that might entirely break, as it appeared
to be breaking, but never could forget.</p>

<p>There was little sleep for the eyes of Effie on the succeeding
night. Her sobs reached the ears of her parents, who,
unable to yield her consolation, were obliged to leave her
to wrestle with her grief; sending up a silent prayer to
the Author of all good dispensations, that He might assuage
the sorrow of one who had already, with exemplary patience,
submitted to the rod of affliction. The sacredness of her
feelings was too well appreciated by her parents to admit of
any offer of counsel, where deep-seated affection, the work of
mysterious instinct, stood in solemn derision of the vulgar
ideas of this world's expediency. The struggle in her mind
arose from the strength of her love, and the power of her
filial devotion. No part of the attendant circumstances or
probable consequences of her decision escaped her mind. She
knew that she never could be happy as the wife of any
other individual, even of suitable age, than Lewis Campbell.
But this concerned only herself; and she knew, and trembled
as she thought, that the result of her decision might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the destitution, the want, perhaps the death of her parents;
their all depended on the breath of the man whom she, by
the sign of her finger, might change from a friend to a foe;
and she might thereby become the destroyer of those who
gave her being.</p>

<p>The morning came, but brought neither sleep nor relief to
the unhappy maiden. Her parents seemed inclined not to
advert to the subject that day, but to let her struggle on
with her own thoughts. The hour of the Laird's visit approached,
and he was already on the road for the home of
his beloved, whom his ardent fancy pictured standing smiling
at the door, ready as usual to receive him and lead him
into the house. Donald&mdash;who knew a reverie in his master
bettor than he did himself, and did not fail to take advantage
of it&mdash;ambled on with diminished speed. The Laird
approached the cottage. No Effie was there. His bright
visions took flight, and were succeeded by a cold shiver, the
precursor of a gloomy train of ideas, which pictured a refusal
and all its attendant horrors. He drew up the head of
Donald, and even invited him to partake of the long grass
which grew by the way-side. He counted the moments as
Donald devoured the food; and, from time to time, lifted
his eyes to see if Effie was yet at the cottage door. She was
not, to be seen&mdash;and she had not been absent before for
many months. His mind was unprepared for a refusal;
the ground-swell of his previous excited fancy distracted him
amidst the dead stillness of despair. He looked again,
and for the last time that day. Effie was not yet there.
He turned the head of the delighted, and no doubt astonished
Donald, and quietly sought again the house of Burnbank.</p>

<p>The same procedure was gone through on the succeeding
day. Laird Cherrytrees again proceeded to the cottage of
David Mearns; and, as he sauntered along, he thought it
impossible that Effie should again be absent from her post.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
He was too good a man, and too conceited a lover, as all
old lovers are, to allow his mind to dwell on the probable
operation of necessity and the fear of injuring her father's
patron, on the mind of the daughter; and yet a lurking,
rebellious idea suggested that he would rather see Effie at
the door, impelled by that cause, than absent altogether.
His hopes again beat high, and Donald was pricked on to
the goal of his wishes with an asperity he did not relish so
well as a reverie. The spot was attained. Effie was still
absent. Donald was again remitted to the long grass, and
all the resources of a lover's mind were called up, to enable
him to face the evil that awaited him. But all was in vain&mdash;he
found it impossible to proceed.</p>

<p>"I am rejected," he muttered to himself, with a sigh; "a
cottager's dochter has refused the Laird o' Burnbank; but
her cauldness an' cruelty mak me like her the mair. Effie
Mearns, Effie Mearns! hoo little do ye ken what commotion
ye hae produced in this puir, burstin heart! But,
though ye winna hae me, I winna desert yer faither. Hame,
Donald, to Burnbank." And, as he pulled up the bridle
with his left hand, he wiped away the tears that had collected
in his eyes, and, casting many a look back to the cottage,
cantered slowly home.</p>

<p>These proceedings of the Laird had been noticed by Betty
Mearns from the window of the cottage, and she and
David were at no loss to guess the cause of them. They
knew his timid, sensitive disposition, and truly attributed
his return to his not seeing Effie at the door waiting for him
as usual. Apprehensions now seized the good mother, that
the Laird might withdraw his attentions and assistance
from the family, the result of which would be nothing but
misery and ruin; as David's fractured limbs were yet far
from being healed, and a long period must yet pass before
he could earn a penny to keep in their lives. These fears
were increased by a third and a fourth day having passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
without a visit from the Laird, who had, notwithstanding,
been seen reconnoitering as usual at a distance from the
cottage. Effie herself saw how matters stood, and learned,
from the looks of her father and mother, sentiments they
seemed unwilling to declare. She was still much convulsed
with the struggle of the antagonist duties, wishes, emotions,
and fears, that rose in her mind; and the apprehensions
of her parents, which she considered well-founded,
added to her sorrow an additional source of anguish.</p>

<p>"This house," said David, at last overcome by his feelings,
"has become mair like an hospital that has lost its
mortification than an honest man's cottage. Effie sits greetin
an' sabbin the hail day, an' you, Betty, look forward to starvation,
wi' the gruesome face o' despair. I am unhappy
mysel, besides being an invalid. What is this to end in?
What are we to do? How are we to live withoot meat, now
that Burnbank, guid man, has deserted us?"</p>

<p>"There has come naething frae Burnbank for five days,"
replied Betty; "an' the siller I got frae the guid auld man,
the last time he was here, I payed awa i' the village for
necessaries I had taen on afore we got that help. Our girnel
winna haud oot lang against three mous; an' if Laird
Cherrytrees bides awa muckle langer, I see naething for it
but to beg."</p>

<p>The tear started to the eye of David. He looked at
Effie. She wept and sobbed, and covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>"Effie, woman," said David, "a' this micht hae been
averted if ye had just gane to the door, an' welcomed the
auld Laird, as ye were wont. He's a blate man, though a
guid carl; an' he has, nae doot, thocht he was unwelcome
when yer auld practice o' waitin for him was gien
up."</p>

<p>"I tauld her that, David," said Betty, "an' pressed her to
gang to the door, though it was only to gie the blate Laird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a glimpse o' her, whilk was a' he wanted to bring him in;
but she only sabbed the mair. Unhappy hour she first saw
that callant, wha may now be dead or married for ought
she kens!&mdash;an yet for his sake maun a hail family dree
the dule o' this day's misery. Effie, woman, can ye no
forget are wha hasna thocht ye worth the trouble o
tellin ye, by ae scrape o' his pen, whether he be i' the
land o' the livin!"</p>

<p>A sob was the only reply Effie could make to this
appeal.</p>

<p>"I hae tauld Effie," said David, "what wad save us frae
the ruin an' starvation that stare us i' the face; but my
mind's made up to suffer to the end, though I should lie
here wi' my broken banes, and dree the pains o' hunger,
rather than force my dochter to marry a man against her
ain choice. But, O Effie, woman, wad ye see yer puir
faither, broken as he is baith in mind and body, lie starvin
here in his bed, wi' nae mair pooer to earn a bite o' bread
than the unspeaned bairn, and no mak a sacrifice to save
him?"</p>

<p>"Ay, faither," replied Effie, "I wad dee to save ye."</p>

<p>"But deein winna save either him or me," said Betty.
"Naething will hae that effect but yer agreein to be the
leddy o' the braw hoose an' braid acres o' Burnbank. Wae's
me! what a difference between that condition, wi' servants
at yer nod, an' a' the comforts an' luxuries o' life at yer
command, an', abune a', the pooer o' makin happy yer
auld faither and mother, an' this awfu prospect o' dreein the
very warst an' last o' a' the evils o' life&mdash;want an' auld
age&mdash;ill-matched pair! Effie, woman, my bonny bairn, hae
ye nae love in yer heart, but for Lewie Campbell? Wad
ye, for his sake, see a' this misfortune fa' on the heads o'
yer parents, whom, by the laws o' God an' man, ye are bound
to honour, serve, and obey?"</p>

<p>It was easier for Effie to say she would die to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
her parents, than that she would comply with the wish
of her mother; but the feeling appeal of her parent increased
her agony, which induced another paroxysm of
hysterical sobs&mdash;the only answer she could yet make to her
mother.</p>

<p>"Effie doesna care for either you or me, Betty," said
David, "or she wad hae little hesitation aboot marryin a
guid, fresh, clean, rich, auld man, to save her faither and
mother frae poverty and starvation. I see nae great sacrifice
i' the matter. Her young heart mayna rejoice i' the
pleasures o' a daft love, but her guid sense will be gratified
by a feelin o' duty far aboon the vain, frawart freaks o' a
silly, giddy, youthfu passion. Let her refuse Laird Cherrytrees,
an' when Lewie Campbell comes hame, the owrecome
bread o' the funeral o' her faither may grace a waddin
bought wi' the price o' his life."</p>

<p>"Dinna speak that way, faither," cried Effie, lifting up her
hands; "I canna stand that. You said ye wadna force me,
an' ye <i>are</i> forcin me. Oh, my puir heart, wha or what will
support ye when grief for my parents turns me against ye?
Faither, faither, when I am dead, Laird Cherrytrees will
be again yer friend. A little time will do't: will ye no
wait?"</p>

<p>"Hunger waits only eight days, as the sayin is," replied
he, "an ye'll live mair than that time, I hope an' trow. I
will be dead afore ye, Effie, an' ye'll hae the consolation, as
ye maybe drap a tear on the mossy grey stane that covers
the Mearnses i' the kirkyard o' our parish, to think, if ye
shouldna like to say, in case ye micht be heard&mdash;though
thinkin an' speakin's a' ane to God&mdash;that 'that stane was
lifted ten years suner than it micht hae been, because
I liked Lewie Campbell better than auld Laird Cherrytrees.'"</p>

<p>"An' it's no likely," said the mother, "that I wad be
there to hear Effie mak sae waefu a speech. If I binna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
lyin wi' the Mearns, I'll be wi' the Cherrytrees o' Mossnook&mdash;nae
relations o' the Burnbanks, though maybe as guid a
family. But, afore I'm mixed wi' the dust o' that auld hoose,
Effie&mdash;an' it mayna be lang&mdash;ye may join the twa Cherrytrees,
an' let the gravestanes o' the Mearns, as weel as the
Mossnooks, lie yet a score years langer withoot bein moved.
It's a pity to disturb the lang grass. Its sough i' the nichtwind
keeps the bats frae pickin the auld banes, an' maybe
it may save yer mother's, if ye send her there afore her time."</p>

<p>Effie's feelings could no longer withstand these appeals.
Her sobbing ceased suddenly; and, starting up from her
seat, she looked to the old clock that stood against the wall
of the cottage. She noticed that it was upon the hour of
the Laird's usual visit.</p>

<p>"It is twelve o'clock, faither," she said, firmly&mdash;"this
hoor decides the fate o' Effie Mearns."</p>

<p>Walking to the door, she placed herself in the position
she used to occupy when she intended to welcome her
father's friend. Now she was to welcome a husband. Laird
Cherrytrees was, as might have been expected, allowing
Donald to take his liberty of the road-side, grazing while he
was busy reconnoitering the cottage. The moment he saw
the form of Effie standing where he had for several long
days wished to see her, he pulled up Donald's bridle with
the alacrity of youth, and, striking his sides with his unarmed
heels, made all the speed of a bridegroom to get to
his bride. The sight of the object he had gazed upon so
unceasingly for so long a time, and whom he had strained
his eyes in vain to see during these eventful days, operated
like a charm on the old lover. He discovered at first sight
the red, swollen eyes of Effie; but he was too happy in
thinking he had been successful, as he had no doubt he had,
to meditate on the struggle which produced his bliss. Having
taken a long draught of the fountain of his hopes and
happiness, and feasted his eyes on the face of the maiden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
who attempted to smile through her tears, which he did
sitting on his horse, and, without speaking a word&mdash;for,
loquacious in politics or rural economy, he was mute in love&mdash;he
dismounted, while Effie, as usual, held the reins. He
lost no time in getting into his chair, falling back into it
like a breathless traveller who has at last attained the end
of his journey. David and Betty, who construed Effie's
conduct into a consent, took an early opportunity, while she
was still at the door, of letting the happy Laird know that
their daughter, as they conceived, was inclined to the match.
The Laird received the intelligence as if it had been too
much for mortal to bear. He was at first beyond the
vulgar habit of speech. He sighed, turned his eyes in their
sockets, groaned, and wrung his hands. On recovering
himself, he exclaimed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whar is she, Betty? Let me see the dear creature.
David, ye'll hae Ravelrigg; it's the best o' them a'. Whan
is't to be, Betty? Ye maun fix the day; an' ye maun
brak the thing to Lucy, and to Jenny Mucklewham; for I
hae nae pooer. Let me see her&mdash;let me see the sweet
creature this instant."</p>

<p>Effie, at the request of her mother, came in and resumed
her seat on the three-footed stool. Her eyes were still
swollen, and she looked sorrowfully at her father. The
Laird fixed his eyes on her; but his loquacity was gone.
He had not a word to say; but his "glowrin" was in some
degree changed, being accompanied by a soft smile of self-complacency
and contentment, and freed from the nervous
irritability with which he used to solicit with his eyes a
look from the object of his affections. His visit this day
was shorter than it used to be. Next day, Betty was to
visit Burnbank, to arrange for the marriage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the unfortunate girl resigned herself as a
self-sacrifice into the hands of her mother. Bound with
the silken bands of filial affection, she renounced all desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of exercising her own free-will, or indulging in those feelings
of the female heart which are deemed so strong as to demand
the sacrifice often of all other earthly considerations.
The fate of Iphiginia has occupied the pens and tongues of
pitying mortals for thousands of years. A lovely woman
sacrificed for a fair wind, doomed to have the blood that
mantled in the blushing cheeks of beauty sprinkled on the
altar of a false religion, is a spectacle which the imagination
cannot contemplate without a participation of the strongest
sympathies of the heart; yet there are, in the common
every-day world we now live in, many a scene in the act of
being performed, where, though there is no bloodshed and
no smoking altar exhibited, the sacrifice is not less than
that of the Grecian victim. Our blessed, holy altar of
matrimony is often, by the wayward feelings of man&mdash;for
we here say nothing of vice or corrupt conduct&mdash;made more
cruel than those of Moloch and Chiun. There is many a
bloodless Iphiginia in those days, whose sufferings are unknown
and unsung, because confined to the heart that
broke over them and concealed them in death. The young,
tender, and devoted female, who, for the love she bears to
her parents, consents to intermarry with rich age, to embrace
dry bones, to extend her sympathies to churlishness,
caprice, and ill-nature, or, what is worse, to the asthmatic
giggle of a superannuated love, while all the while her
heart, cheated of its tribute and swelling with indignation,
requires to be watched by her with vigilance and firmness,
the cruelty of which she herself feels&mdash;presents a form of self-sacrifice
possessing claims on the pity of mankind beyond
those of the boasted self-immolation of ancient devotees.</p>

<p>The silence and dejection of our bride were construed, by
her parents, into that seemly and becoming sedateness
which sensible young women think it proper to assume on
the eve of so important a change in their condition as
marriage; while the happy bridegroom had come to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
time of life when he is pleased with submission, though it
be expressed through tears. No chemical menstruum has
so much power in the dissolution of the hardest metals as
the self-complacency of an old lover has in construing, according
to his wishes, the actions, words, or looks of the
young woman who is destined to be his bride. Silence and
tears are expressive of happiness as well as of grief; and, so
long as the desire of the ancient philosopher is uncomplied
with by the gods, and there is no window to the heart, that
organ in the young victim may break while the sexagenarian
bridegroom is enjoying the imputed silent, restrained happiness
of the object of his ill-timed affection.</p>

<p>The sadness and melancholy of the apparently-resigned
Effie Mearns had no effect on the noise and show of the
preparations for her marriage with her old lover. The
marriages of old men are well known to be celebrated
with higher bugle notes from the trumpet of fame than any
others. A sumptuous dinner was to be given to the neighbouring
lairds, and the cotters were to be fed and regaled
on the green opposite to the mansion. Dancing and music
were to add their charms to the gay scene; and it was
even alleged that the light of a bonfire would lend its
peculiar aid, in raising the joy of the guests, predisposed to
hilarity by plenteous potations, to the proper height suited
to the conquest of the old bridegroom over, at once, a young
woman and old Time.</p>

<p>For days previous to the eventful one, Effie Mearns was
not heard to open her lips. She looked on all the gay preparations
for her marriage as if they had been the mournful
acts of the undertaker employed in laying the silver trimming
on the coffin lid of a lover. The bedside of her sick
parent, who was still unable to rise, was the place where she
sat "shrouded in silence." She heard the conversations of
her father and mother about the progress of the preparations,
without exhibiting so much interest as to show that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
understood them. Misgivings crossed the minds of the old
couple, and brought tears to their eyes, as they contemplated
the animated corpse that sat there, waiting the nod
of the master of ceremonies, and ready to perform the part
assigned to it in the forthcoming orgies of mournful joy;
but they had gone too far to recede, and it was even a subject
of satisfaction to them that the period of the celebration
was so near, for otherwise they might have had reason to
fear that their daughter would not have survived the intermediate
time. When the bridegroom called, his ears were
alarmed by the voices of the parents, who saw the necessity
of endeavouring to hide the condition of their daughter;
and he was satisfied, if he got, free and unrestrained, "a
feast of the eyes." His love was still expressed by silent
gazing; for it was too deep in his old heart for either words
or tears; if, indeed, there was moisture enough in the seat
of his affection for the suppliance of the <i>softest</i> expression
of the soft passion.</p>

<p>The eventful day arrived. The marriage was to take
place in the cottage, where David Mearns still lay confined
to bed. The sick man wore a marriage favour attached to
the breast of his shirt!&mdash;for Laird Cherrytrees would be contented
with no less a demonstration of his participation
in his unparalleled happiness. The still silent bride <i>submitted</i>
passively to all the acts of her nimble dressers,
whose laugh seemed to strike her ears like funeral bells;
yet she tried&mdash;poor victim! to smile, though the clouded
beam came through a tear which, by its steadfastness,
seemed to belong to the orb. The bridegroom came at the
very instant when he ought to have come&mdash;the hand of the
clock not having had time to leave the mark of notation. He
was dressed in the style of his earliest days, with cocked
hat, laced coat, and a sky-blue vest, embroidered in the
richest manner; while a new wig, ordered from the metropolis,
imparted to him the freshness of youth. His cheek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was flushed with the blood which joy had forced, for a moment,
from where it was more needed, at the drying fountain
of life; and his eye spoke a happiness which his parched
tongue could not have achieved, without causing shame even
to himself. Everything was new, spruce, perking, self-complacent.
The clergyman next came, and all was prepared.</p>

<p>Throughout all this time and all these preparations, not
the slightest change had been observed on the bride. After
she was dressed, she took her seat again, silently by the side
of her father's sickbed, where she sat like a statue. The
ceremony was now to commence, and she stood up, when
required by the clergyman, as if she obeyed the command
of an executioner. It was noticed that she seemed to incline
to be as near as possible to her father's bed; and her unwillingness
or inability to come forward forced the clergyman
and the bridegroom some paces from the situation they
at first held. The ceremony proceeded till it came to the
part where the consent of the parties is asked. The happy
bridegroom pronounced his response, quick, sharp, and with
an air of conceit, which brought a smile to the faces of the
parties present. There was now a pause for the consent of
the bride. All eyes were fixed on her death-like face. A
severe struggle was going on in her bosom; yet her countenance
was unmoved, and no one conjectured that she
suffered more than sensitive females often do in her situation.
The clergyman repeated his question. There was
still a pause&mdash;the eyes of all were riveted on her. "I <i>canna</i>,
I <i>canna</i>!" at last she exclaimed, in a voice of agony, and fell
back on the bed&mdash;a corpse!</p>

<p>Six months after the death of Effie Mearns, Lucy Cherrytrees
was married, without faint or swoon, to Lewis Campbell,
who returned home, in spite of his reported death. The
union was against the consent of the Laird, who soon died
of either a broken heart or old age&mdash;no doctor could have
told which.</p>

<h2>GLEANINGS OF THE COVENANT.</h2>

<h3>XIV.  &mdash;JAMES RENWICK.</h3>


<p>In the times in which we live, party spirit is carried very
far. Many honest tradesmen, merchants, and shopkeepers,
are ruined by their votes at elections. The ordinary intercourse
of social life is obstructed and deranged. Friends go
up to the polling station with friends, but separate there,
and become, it may be, the most inveterate enemies. This,
our later reformation of 1832, has cost us much; but our
sufferings are nothing to those which marked the two previous
reformations from Popery and Prelacy. In the one
instance, fire and faggot were the ordinary means adopted
for defending political arrangements; in the other, the gallows
and the maiden did the same work, and the boots and
the thumbikins acted as ministering engines of torture. The
whole of society was convulsed; men's blood boiled in their
veins at the revolting sights which were almost daily obtruding
upon their attention; and their judgments being
greatly influenced by their feelings, it is not to be wondered
at that they should, in a few instances, have overshot, as it
were, the mark&mdash;have sacrificed their lives to the support of
opinions which appear now not materially different from
those which their enemies pressed upon their acceptance.
It is a sad mistake to suppose that the friends of Presbytery,
during the fearful twenty-eight years' persecution of Charles
and James, died in the support of certain doctrines and
forms of church government merely. With these were,
unhappily, or rather, as things have turned out, fortunately,
combined, political or civil liberty, the establishment and
support of a supreme power, vested in King, Lords, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Commons&mdash;instead of being vested, by usurpation, merely
in the King alone. By avoiding to call Parliaments, and by
obtaining supplies of money from France and otherwise, the
two last of the Stuart Despots had, in fact, broken the compact
of Government, and had exposed themselves all along,
through the twenty-eight years of persecution, to dethronement
for high treason. This was the strong view taken by
those who fought and who fell at Bothwell Bridge, and this
was the view taken by nine-tenths of the inhabitants of
Scotland&mdash;of the descendants and admirers of Bruce and
Wallace&mdash;of Knox and Carstairs. James Renwick, the
last of the martyrs in the cause of religion and liberty, was
executed in Edinburgh in his twenty-sixth year. He was a
young man of liberal education, conducted both at the college
of Edinburgh, and Groningen, abroad&mdash;of the most amiable
disposition, and the most unblemished moral character&mdash;yet,
simply because he avowed, and supported, and publicly
preached doctrines on which, in twelve months after his
execution, the British Government was based, he was adjudged
to the death, and ignominiously executed in the presence
of his poor mother and other relatives, as well as of
the Edinburgh public. Mr Woodrow, in his history of this
man's life, alludes to some papers which he had seen, containing
notices of Mr Renwick's trials and hair-breadth escapes;
prior to his capture and execution&mdash;which, however, he refrains
from giving to the public. It so happens that, from
my acquaintance with a lineal descendent of the last of the
Martyrs, I have it in my power, in some measure, to supply
the deficiency; his own note, or memorandum-book, being
still in existence, though it never has been, nor ever will,
probably, be published.</p>

<p>It was in the month of January 1688, that Mr Renwick
was preaching, after nightfall, to a few followers, at Braid
Craigs, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. The night was
stormy&mdash;a cold east wind, with occasional blasts of snow&mdash;whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the moon, in her second quarter, looked out, at intervals,
on plaids and bonnets nestled to the leeward of
rocks and furze. It was a piteous sight to view rational and
immortal creatures reduced to a state upon the level with the
hares and the foxes. Renwick discoursed to them from the
point of a rock which protruded over the lee side of the
Craigieknowe. His manner was solemn and impressive. He
was a young man of about twenty-five years of age; and his
mother, Elspeth Carson, sat immediately before him&mdash;an
old woman of threescore and upwards&mdash;in her tartan plaid
and velvet hood. Her son had been born to a larger promise,
and had enjoyed an excellent academic education;
and much it had originally grieved the old woman's heart
to find all her hopes of seeing him minister of her native
parish of Glencairn, blasted; but his conscience would not
allow him to conform; and she had followed him in his wanderings
and field-preachings, through Ayrshire, Renfrewshire,
and all along by the Pentland Hills, to Edinburgh,
where a sister of hers was married, and lived in a respectable
way on the Castle Hill. This evening, after psalm-singing
and prayer, Mr. Renwick had chosen for his text
these words, in the fourth verse of the eighteenth chapter of
the book of Revelation&mdash;"Come out of her, my people."
The kindly phrase, "my people," was beautifully insisted
upon.</p>

<p>"There ye are," said Renwick, stretching out his hand to
the darkening sleet; "there ye are, a poor, shivering, fainting,
despised, persecuted remnant, whom the great ones despise,
and the men of might, and of war, and of blood, cut
down with their swords, and rack with their tortures. Ye
are, like ye'r great Master, despised and rejected of men; but
the Master whom ye serve, and whom angels serve with
veiled faces, and even He who created and supports the
sun, the moon, and the stars, He&mdash;blessed be His name!&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
not ashamed to acknowledge ye, under all your humiliation,
as <i>His</i> people. 'Come out of her,' says He, '<i>my people</i>.' O,
sirs, this is a sweet and a loving invitation. Ye are '<i>His
people</i>,' the sheep of His pasture, after all; and who would
have thought it, that heard ye, but yesterday, denounced at
the cross of Edinburgh as traitors, and rebels, and non-conformists,
as the offscourings of the earth, the filth and the
abomination in the eyes and in the nostrils of the great and
the mighty? 'Come out!' says the text, and out ye have
come&mdash;'done ere ye bade, guid Lord!' Ye may truly and
reverentially say&mdash;Here we are, guid Lord; we have come
out from the West Port, and from the Grassmarket, and
from the Nether Bow, and from the Canongate&mdash;out we
have come, because we are thy people. We know thy voice,
and thy servants' voice, and a stranger and a hireling, with
his stipend and his worldly rewards, will we not follow; but
we will listen to him whose reward is with him; whose stipend
is Thy divine approbation; whose manse is the wilderness;
and whose glebe land is the barren rock and the
shelterless knowe. Come out of <i>her</i>. There <i>she</i> sits," (pointing
towards Edinburgh, now visible in the scattered rays of the
moon,) "there she sits, like a lady, in her delicacies, and her
drawing-rooms, and her ball-rooms, and her closetings, and
her abominations. Ye can almost hear the hum of her many
voices on the wings of the tempest. There she sits in her
easy chair, stretching her feet downwards, from west to
east, from castle to palace! But she has lost her first love,
and has deserted her covenanted husband. She hath gone
astray&mdash;she hath gone astray!&mdash;and He who made her hath
denounced her&mdash;He whose she was in the day of her betrothment,
hath said&mdash;She is no longer mine; 'come out of
her, my people'&mdash;be not misled by her witcheries, and her
dalliance, and her smiles&mdash;be not terrified by her threats,
and cruelties, and her murderings&mdash;she is drunk, she is
drunk&mdash;and with the most dangerous and intoxicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
beverage, too&mdash;she is drunk with the blood of the saints.
When shipwrecked and famishing sailors kill each other,
and drink the blood, it is written that they immediately
become mad, and, uttering all manner of blasphemies, expire!
Thus it is with the 'Lady of the rock'&mdash;she is now
in her terrible blasphemies, and will, by and by, expire in
her frenzy. And who sits upon her throne?&mdash;even the
bloody Papist, who misrules these unhappy lands&mdash;he, the
usurper of a throne from which by law he is debarred&mdash;even
the cruel and Papistical <i>Duke</i>, whom men, in their folly or
in their fears, denominate '<span class="smcap">King</span>'&mdash;he, too, is doomed&mdash;the
decree hath gone forth, and he will perish with her, because
he would not <i>come out</i>."</p>

<p>"Will he, indeed, Mr Bletherwell? But there are some
here who must perish first." So said the wily and infuriated
Claverhouse, as he poured in his men by a signal from
the adjoining glen, (where the lonely hermitage now stands
in its silent beauty,) and in an instant had made Renwick,
and about ten of his followers&mdash;the old woman, his mother,
included&mdash;prisoners. This was done in an instant, for the
arrangements had been made prior to the hour of meeting,
and Claverhouse, attired in plaid and bonnet, had actually
sat during the whole discourse, listening to the speaker till
once he should utter something treasonable, when, by rising
on a rock, and shaking the corners of his plaid, he brought
the troop up from their hiding-places, amidst the whins and
the broom by which the glen was at that time covered.
Renwick, seeing all resistance useless, and indeed forbidding
his followers, who were not unprovided for the occasion, to
fire upon the military, marched onwards, in silence, towards
Edinburgh. As they passed along by the land now denominated
"Canaan," they halted at a small public-house kept
by a woman well known at the time by the nickname of
"Red-herrings," on account of her making frequent use of
these viands to stimulate a desire for her strong drink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Over her door-way, indeed, a red-herring and a foaming
tankard were rudely sketched on a sign-board, (like cause
and effect, or mere sequence!) in loving unity. The prisoners
were accommodated with standing-room in Tibby's
kitchen; while the soldiers, with their leader, occupied the
ben-room and the only doorway&mdash;thus securing their prisoners
from all possibility of escape. Refreshments, such as
Tibby could muster, consisting principally of brandy and
ale, mixed up in about equal proportions of each, were distributed
amongst the soldiers&mdash;who were, in fact, from their
long exposure in the open air, in need of some such stimulants;
whilst the poor prisoners were only watched, and
made a subject of great merriment by the soldiers. The
halt, however, was very temporary; but, temporary as it
was, it enabled several of the members of the field-meeting
to reach Edinburgh, and to apprise their friends, and
what is termed the mob of the streets, of the doings at
"Braid Craigs." Onwards advanced the party&mdash;soldiers
before and behind, and their captives in the middle&mdash;till
they reached the West Port, at the foot of the Grassmarket.
It was near about ten o'clock, and the streets were in a buz
with idle 'prentices, bakers' boys, shoemakers' lads, &amp;c.
The march along the Grassmarket seemed to alarm Clavers,
for he halted his men, made them examine their firelocks,
spread themselves all around the prisoners, and, advancing
himself in front, and on his famous black horse, with drawn
sword and holster pistols, seemed to set all opposition
at defiance. The party had already gained the middle of
that narrow and winding pass, the West Bow, when a waggon,
heavily loaded with stones, was hurled downwards upon
the party, with irresistible force and rapidity&mdash;Clavers's
horse shied, and escaped the moving destruction; but it
came full force into the very midst of the soldiers, who,
from a natural instinct, turned off into open doors and side
closes; in this they were imitated by the poor prisoners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
who were better acquainted with the localities of the West
Bow than the soldiery. In an instant afterwards, a dense
and armed mob rushed headlong down the street, carrying
all before them, and shouting aloud, "Renwick for ever!
Renwick for ever!" This was taken as a hint by the prisoners,
who, in an instant, had mixed with the mob; or
sunk, as it were, through the earth, into dark passages and
cellars. "Fire!" was Claverhouse's immediate order, so
soon as the human torrent had reached him; and <i>fire</i> some
of the soldiers did, but not to the injury of any of the prisoners,
but to that of a person&mdash;a bride, as it turned out&mdash;who,
in her curiosity or fear, had looked from a window
above; she was shot through the head, and died instantly.
But, in the meantime, the rescue was complete&mdash;Claverhouse,
afraid manifestly of being shot from a window, galloped
up the brae, and made the best of his way to the
Castle, there to demand fresh troops to quell what he called
an insurrection: whilst, in the meantime, the men, after a
very temporary search or pursuit, marched onwards, with
their muskets presented to the open windows, in case any
head should protrude. But no heads were to be seen; and
the soldiers escaped to the guard-house (to the Heart of
Midlothian) in safety. Here, however, a scene ensued of a
most heart-rending nature. Scarcely had the men grounded
their muskets in the guard-house, when a seeming maniac
rushed upon them with an open knife, and cut right and
left like a fury. He was immediately secured, but not till
after many of the soldiers were bleeding profusely. They
thrust him immediately, bound hand and foot, into the
black-hole, to await the decision of next morning; but next
morning death had decided his fate&mdash;he had manifestly died
of apoplexy, brought on by extreme excitement. His
mother, who had followed her son when he issued forth deprived
seemingly of reason, having lost sight of him in the
darkness, had learned next morning of his fate and situation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
She came, therefore, with the return of light, to
the prison door, and had been waiting hours before it was
opened. At last Clavers arrived, and ordered the maniac
to be brought into his presence, and that of the Court, for
examination. But it was all over; and the distorted limbs
and features of a young and handsome man were all the
mark by which a fond mother could certify the identity of
an only son. From this poor woman's examination, it
turned out that her son was to have been married on that
very day to a young woman whom he had long loved; but
that he had been called to see her corpse, after she was shot
by the soldiery, and had rushed out in the frantic and armed
manner already described. The poor woman, from that
hour, became melancholy; refused to take food; and, always
calling upon the names of her "bonny murdered bairns,"
was found dead one morning in her bed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, James Renwick had made the best of
his way down the Cowgate, and across, by a narrow wynd,
into the Canongate, where a friend of his kept a small public-house.
He had gone to bed; but his wife was still at the
bar, and two men sat drinking in a small side apartment.
He asked immediately for her husband, and was
recognised, but with a wink and a look which but too
plainly spoke her suspicion of the persons who were witnesses
of his entrance. Hereupon he called for some refreshment,
as if he had been a perfect stranger, and,
seating himself at a small table, began to read in a little
note-book which he took from his side pocket&mdash;"four,
five, six, seven&mdash;yes, seven," said he&mdash;"and it has cost
me seven pounds my journey to Edinburgh." This he said
so audibly as to be heard by the persons who were sitting
in the adjoining box, that they might regard him as a
stranger, and unconnected with Edinburgh. But, as he
afterwards expressed it, he deeply repented of the attempt
to mislead. The Lord, he said, had justly punished him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
for distrusting his power to extricate him, as he had already
done, from his troubles. The men, after one had accosted
him in a friendly tone about the weather, or some indifferent
subject, took their departure; and Mrs Chalmers
and he, now joined by the husband, enjoyed one hour's
canny crack ere bedtime, over some warm repast. The
whole truth was made known to them; but, though perfectly
trustworthy themselves, they expressed a doubt of
their customers, who were known to be little better than
hired informers, who went about to public-houses, at the
expense of the Government, listening and prying if they
could find any evidence against the poor Covenanters.
Next day, even before daylight, the house was surrounded
by armed men, and Renwick was demanded by name.
Mr Chalmers did not deny that he was in the house, but
said that he came to him as to a distant relation, and that
he was no way connected with his doctrines or opinions.
In the meantime, Renwick was aroused, and had resolved
to sell his life as dearly as possible. He was a young
and an active man, and trusted, as he owned with great
regret afterwards, to his strength and activity, rather than
to the mercy and the wisdom of his Maker. So, rushing
suddenly down stairs, and throwing himself, whilst discharging
a pistol, (which, however, did no harm), into the
street, he was out of sight in a twinkling; but, in passing
along, his hat fell off; and this circumstance drew the attention
and suspicion of every one whom he passed, to
his appearance. One foot, in particular, pressed hard upon
him from behind, and a voice kept constantly crying,
"Stop thief!&mdash;stop thief!" He ran down a blind alley, on
the other side of the Canongate, and was at last taken,
without resistance, by three men, one of whom&mdash;and it was
the one who had all along pursued him&mdash;was the person
who had accosted him last night in the public-house, respecting
the weather. He was immediately carried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
prison, where he remained&mdash;visited indeed by his mother&mdash;till
next assizes, when he was tried, condemned, and afterwards
executed&mdash;the Last of the Martyrs!</p>

<p>The conversation which he had with his mother, his
public confessions of faith, and adherence to the covenanted
cause, as well as his last address, drowned at the
time in the sound of drums&mdash;all these are given at full
length in Woodrow, (the edition of Dr Burns of Paisley),
to which I must refer the reader who is curious upon such
subjects. In this valuable work will likewise be found the
inscription placed upon a very handsome cippus, or monument
of stone, erected to his memory. We give it to the
reader. There is another, if we mistake not, in the Greyfriars
of Edinburgh, somewhat in the same style. They
are both equally simple and touching.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />
<h3><a name="OLD_ISBEL_KIRK" id="OLD_ISBEL_KIRK"></a>XV.  &mdash;OLD ISBEL KIRK.</h3>

<p>Isbel Kirk lived in Pothouse, Closeburn, in that very
house where that distinguished scholar, the late Professor
Hunter of St Andrew's, was born. She had never been
married, and lived in a small lonely cottage, with no companions
but her cat and cricket, which chirped occasionally
from beneath the hudstone, against which her peat-fire was
built. There sat old, and now nearly blind, Isbel Kirk,
spinning or carding wool, crooning occasionally an old
Scotch song, or, it might be, one of David's psalms, and
enjoying at intervals her pipe, a visit from her next
neighbour, Nancy Nivison, or her champit-potatoes&mdash;a
luxury which the west country, and that alone, has hitherto
enjoyed. Two old Irish women had settled some time before
this on the skirts of the opposite brae, where they had
built a small turf cabin, and lived nobody could well tell
how. They were generally understood to make a kind of
precarious living, by going about the country periodically,
giving <i>pigs</i> or crockery-ware in exchange for wool. Isbel
Kirk was a most simple, honest creature, living on little,
but procuring that little by her industry in spinning sale
yarn, weaving garters, and using her needle occasionally, to
assist the guidwife of Gilchristland in shirt-making for a
large family. But the M'Dermots were the aversion of
everybody, and seldom visited even by the guidman of
Barmoor, on whose farm, or rather on the debatable skirts
of it, they had sat down, almost in spite of his teeth. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was a humane man; and, though he loved not such visitors,
yet he tolerated the nuisance, as his wife reckoned them
skilled in curing children's diseases, and in spaeing the
young women's fortunes. John Watson pastured sheep,
where corn harvests now wave in abundance; and his
flocks spread about to the doors of the M'Dermots and
Isbel Kirk. These flocks gradually decreased, and much
suspicion was attached to his Irish and heathenish neighbours,
for they attended no place of worship, not even the
conformed Curate's; but there was no proof against them.
At last, a search was suddenly and secretly instituted
under the authority of the Laird of Closeburn; and, although
much wool was found, still there were no entire
fleeces, nor any means left of bringing it home to the
M'Dermots.</p>

<p>"Na, na, guidman," said the elder of the two harridans.
"Na&mdash;ye needna stir aboot the kail-pot in that way&mdash;ye'll
find naething there but a fine bit o' the dead braxy I gat
frae the guidman o' Gilchristland, for helping the mistress
wi' her kirn, that wadna mak butter; but there are folks
that ye dinna suspect, and that are maybe no that far off
either, wha could very weel tell ye gin they liked whar yer
braw gimmer yows gang till."</p>

<p>Being pushed to be more particular, they were seemingly
compelled at last to intimate that auld Isbel Kirk,
she and her friend, Nanny Nivison, could give an account
of the stolen sheep, if they liked. The guidman would not
credit such allegations; but the old women persisted in
their averment, and even offered to give the guidman of
Barmoor occular demonstration of the guilt of the twa
<i>saunts</i>, as they called them. A few days passed, and still a
lamb or an old sheep would disappear&mdash;they melted away
gradually, and the guidman began to think that his flocks
must be bewitched, and that the devil himself must keep a
kitchen somewhere about the Chaise Craig, over which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Archy Tait had often seen the <i>old gentleman</i> driving six-in-hand
about twelve o'clock at night. Returning, therefore,
one morning to the M'Dermots, and renewing the conversation
respecting Isbel Kirk and Nanny Nivison, it was agreed
that one of the Irish sisterhood should walk over to Isbel's
with him next forenoon, and that she would give him evidence
of the fate of his flocks. Isbel was sitting before her
door, in the sunshine of a fine spring morning, when the
guidman and Esther M'Dermot arrived. She welcomed
them kindly into her small but clean and neat cottage;
and, with all the despatch which her blindness would permit
of, dusted for their use an old-fashioned chair, and a
round stool, which served the double purpose of stool and
table. The conversation went on as usual about the
weather, and the last sufferer in the cause of the Covenant,
when Esther M'Dermot went into a dark corner, and forthwith
drew out into the guidman's view, and to his infinite
astonishment, a sheep's head, which bore the well-known
mark of the farm on its ears.</p>

<p>"Look there, guidman," said Esther, "isna that proof
positive of the way in which your braw hirsel is disposed
of? By Jasus and the holy St Patrick! and here is a foot
too, and twa horns!"</p>

<p>Poor Isbel Kirk could scarcely be made to apprehend the
meaning of all this&mdash;indeed she could scarcely see the evidences
of her guilt&mdash;and assured the guidman, in the most
unequivocal manner imaginable, that she was innocent as
the child unborn; indeed, she said, what should she do with
dead sheep, or how should she get hold of them, seeing she
was old and blind, and had not enjoyed a bit of mutton, or
any other flesh, meat, since the new year?</p>

<p>"Ay," responded old Esther; "but ye hae friends that can
help ye; dinna I whiles see, after dark, twa tall figures
stealing o'er your way frae the Whitside linn yonder! I'se
warrant they dinna live on deaf nits, after lying a' day in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
dark and damp cave." Isbel held up her hands in prayer,
entreating the Lord to be merciful to her and to his ain
inheritance, and to discomfit the plans of his and her enemies.</p>

<p>"Ye may pray," said Elspat, "as ye like, but ye'll no
mak the guidman here distrust his ain een, wi' yer praying
and yer Whiggery." This last suggestion of the nightly
visitors staggered Mr Watson not a little; he well knew
how friendly old Isbel was to the poor Covenanters, and
brought himself to conclude, under the weighty and conclusive
evidence before him, that Isbel might have persuaded
herself that she was rendering God good service
by feeding his chosen people with the best of his flock.
Isbel could only protest her innocence and ignorance of the
way in which these evidences against her came there;
whilst the guidman and Esther took their leave&mdash;he threatening
that the matter should not rest where it was, and the
old Irish jade pretending to commiserate Isbel on the unfortunate
discovery.</p>

<p>Next morning, the pothouse was surrounded, and carefully
searched by a detachment of Lag's men, to whom information
of Isbel's harbouring rebels had been (the reader
may guess how) communicated. Having been unsuccessful
in their search, they put the poor blind creature to the
torture, because she would not discover, or, perhaps, could
not reveal, the retreat of the persecuted people. A burning
match was put betwixt her fingers, and she was firmly
tied to a bedpost, whilst the fire was blown into a flame by
one of the soldiers. Not a feature in Isbel's countenance
changed; but her lips moved, and she was evidently deeply
absorbed in devotional exercise.</p>

<p>"Come, come, old Bleary," said one, "out with it! or
we will roast you on the coals, like a red herring, for
Beelzebub's breakfast."</p>

<p>"Ye can only do what ye're permitted to do," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
poor sufferer, now writhing with pain, and suffering all
the agonies of martyrdom. "Ye may burn this poor auld
body, and reduce it to its natural dust; but ye will never
hear my tongue betray any of the poor persecuted remnant."</p>

<p>It is horrible to relate, but the fact cannot be disputed,
that these monsters stood by and blew the match till the
poor creature's fingers were actually burnt off&mdash;yet she
only once cried for mercy; but, when they mentioned the
conditions, she fainted; and thus nature relieved her from
her sufferings. When she came again to herself, she
found that they had killed the only living creature which
she could call companion, and actually hung the body of the
dead cat around her neck; but they were gone, and her hands
were untied.</p>

<p>During the ensuing night a watch was set upon poor
Isbel's house, thinking, as the persecutors did, that they
would catch the nightly visitants, who were yet ignorant of
their friend's sufferings in their behalf. The men lay concealed
among brackens, on the bank opposite to the pothouse,
and near to Staffybiggin, the residence of the
M'Dermots. To their surprise, a figure, about twelve o'clock,
came warily and stealthily around a flock of sheep which
lay ruminating in the hollow. It was a female figure,
if not the devil in a female garb. They continued to keep
silent and lie still. At last they saw the whole flock
driven over and across a thick-set bush of fern. One of
the sheep immediately began to struggle; but it was manifestly
held by the foot&mdash;in a few instants, two figures were
seen dragging it into M'Dermot's door. This naturally
excited their surprise, and, rushing immediately into the
hut, they found the two old women in the act of preparing in
a pit&mdash;which, during the day time, was concealed&mdash;mutton
for their own use. The murder was now out. These
wretched women had been in the habit, for some years, of
supplying themselves from the Barmoor flocks; the one
lying flat down upon her back amongst the furze, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
other driving the sheep over her breast. Thus the sister
who caught, had an opportunity of selecting; and the best
of the wedders had thus from time to time disappeared.</p>

<p>Poor Isbel Kirk!&mdash;her innocence was now fully established;
but it was too late. Her kind friend Nanny Nivison
attended her in her last illness, and the guidman of Barmoor
paid every humane attention. But the ruffians of a mistaken
and ill-advised government had deranged her nervous
system. Besides, the burn never properly healed;
it at last mortified, and she died almost insensible, either of
pain or presence. Her soul seemed to have left its frail tabernacle
ere life was extinct. The example we have here given
is taken from that humble source, which the historian leaves
open to the gleaner. Indeed, the histories of those times
give but a very imperfect idea of the atrocities of that remarkable
period. The cottage door must be opened to get at
the truth; but the stately political historian seldom enters.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CURLERS" id="THE_CURLERS"></a>XVI.  &mdash;THE CURLERS.</h3>

<p>Winter 1684-5 was, like the last, cold, frosty, and
stormy. The ice was on lake and muir from new year's
day till the month of March. Curling was then, as it is
still, the great winter amusement in the south and west of
Scotland. The ploughman lad rose by two o'clock of a
frosty morning, had the day's fodder threshed for the
cattle, and was on the ice, besom in hand, by nine o'clock.
The farmer, after seeing things right in the stable and the
byre, was not long behind his servant. The minister left
his study and his M.S., his concordance, and his desk, for
the loch, and the rink, and the channel-stane. Even the
laird himself was not proof against the temptation, but
often preferred full twelve hours of rousing game on the
ice, to all the fascinations of the drawing or the billiard-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
or the study. Even the schoolmaster was incapable
of resisting the tempting and animating sound; and, at
every peal of laughter which broke upon his own and his
pupils' ears, turned his eyes and his steps towards the
window which looked upon the adjoining loch; and, at
last, entirely overcome by the shout over a contested shot;
off he and his bevy swarmed, helter-skelter, across the
Carse Meadow, to the ice. From all accounts which I
have heard of it, this was a notable amongst many notable
days. The factor was never in such play; the master
greatly outdid himself; the laird played hind-hand in
beautiful style; and Sutor John came up the rink "like
Jehu in time o' need." Shots were laid just a yard, right
and left, before and behind the tee; shots were taken out,
and run off the ice with wonderful precision; guards,
that most ticklish of all plays, were rested just over the
hog-score, so as completely to cover the winner; inwicks
were taken to a hair, and the player's stone whirled in
most gracefully, (like a lady in a country dance), and
settled, three-deep-guarded, upon the top of the tee.
Chance had her triumphs as well as good play. A random
shot, driven with such fury that the stone rebounded and
split in two, deprived the opposite side of four shots, and
took the game. The sky was blue as indigo, and the sun
shot his beams over the Keir Hills in penetrating and invigorating
splendour. Old women frequented the loch
with baskets; boys and young lads skated gracefully
around; the whisky-bottle did its duty; and even the
herons at the spring-wells had their necks greatly elongated
by the roaring fun. It was a capital day's sport.
Little did this happy scene exhibit of the suffering and the
misery which was all this while perpetrated by the men of
violence. Clavers, the ever-infamous, was in Wigtonshire
with his Lambs; Grierson was lying in his den of Lag,
like a lion on the spring; Johnstone was on the Annan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and Winram on the Doon; whilst Douglas was here, and
there, and everywhere, flying, like a malevolent spirit, from
strath to strath, and from hill to dale. The snow lay, and
had long been lying, more than a foot deep, crisp and
white, over the bleak but beauteous wild; the sheep were
perishing for want of pasture; and many poor creatures
were in absolute want of the necessaries of life. (The
potato, that true friend of the people, had not yet made
its way to any extent into Scotland). Caves, dens, and outhouses
were crowded with the persecuted flock. The
ousted ministers were still lifting up their voice in the
wilderness, and the distant hum of psalmody was heard
afar amongst the hills, and by the side of the frozen stream
and the bare hawthorn. What a contrast did all this present
to the fun, frolic, and downright ecstacy of this day's
sport! But the night came, with its beef and its greens,
and its song, and its punch, and its anecdote, and its
thrice-played games, and its warm words, and its half-muttered
threats, and its dispersion about three in the morning.</p>

<p>"Wha was yon stranger?" said John Harkness to Sandy
Gibson, as they met next day on the hill. "I didna like
the look o' him; an' yet he played his stane weel, an' took
a great lead in the conversation. I wish he mayna be a
spy, after a'; for I never heard o' ony Watsons in Ecclefechan,
till yon creature cast up."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said lang Sandy, "I didna like the creature&mdash;it
got sae fou an' impudent, late at nicht; an' then that puir
haverel, Will Paterson, cam in, an' let oot that the cave
at Glencairn had been surprised, an' the auld minister
murdered. If it be na the case&mdash;as I believe it isna
hitherto&mdash;there was enough said last nicht to mak it necessary
to hae the puir, persecuted saint informed o' his
danger."</p>

<p>"An' that's as true," responded John; "an' I think
you an' I canna do better than wear awa wast o'er whan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the sun gaes down, an' let honest Mr Lawson ken that his
retreat is known. That Watson creature&mdash;didna ye tent?&mdash;went
aff, wi' the curate, a wee afore the lave; they were
heard busy talking together, in a low tone of voice, as they
went hame to the manse. I wonder what maks the laird&mdash;wha
is a perfect gentleman, an' a friend, too, o' the
Covenanted truth&mdash;keep company, on the ice, or off it,
wi' that rotten-hearted, roupit creature, the curate o' Closeburn?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," replied the other, "he is sae clean daft aboot
playing at channel-stane, that, I believe, baith him, an'
the dominie, an' the factor&mdash;forby Souter Ferguson&mdash;would
play wi' auld Symnie himself, provided he was a
keen and a guid shot! But it will be mirk dark&mdash;an'
there's nae moon&mdash;ere we mak Glencairn cave o't."</p>

<p>John Harkness and Sandy Gibson arrived at Monyaive,
in Glencairn, a little after dark. The cave was about a
mile distant from the town; and, with the view of refreshment,
as well as of concerting the best way of avoiding
suspicion, they entered a small ale-house kept by an old
woman at the farther end of the bridge. They were
shewn into a narrow and meanly-furnished apartment, and
called for a bottle of the best beer, with a suitable accompaniment
of bread and cheese. The landlady, by-and-by,
was sent for, and was asked to partake of her own beverage,
and questioned, in a careless and incidental manner, respecting
the news. She looked somewhat embarrassed;
and, fixing her eyes upon a keyhole, in a door which
conducted to an adjoining apartment, she said, in a whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"I ken brawly wha ye are, an maybe, too, what ye're
after; but ye hae need to be active, lads; for there are those
in that ither room that wadna care though a yer heads, as
well as those o' some ither folks that shall be nameless
were stuck on the West Port o' Edinbro."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>In an instant, the two young farmers were <i>butt</i> the house,
and beside Tibby Haddow's peat fire. In the course of a
short, and, to all but themselves, an inaudible conversation,
they learned that Lag himself, disguised as a common
soldier, was in the next room, in close colloquy with
a person clothed in grey duffle, with a broad bonnet on his
head. From the description of the person, the two Closeburnians
had no manner of doubt that the information
obtained last night, in regard to the existence of a place of
refuge in Glencairn, was now in the act of being communicated.</p>

<p>"At one o'clock!" said a well-known voice&mdash;it was that
of Lag, to a certainty.</p>

<p>"Yes, at one," responded the stranger, Watson&mdash;whose
voice was equally well-known to the farmers&mdash;"at one!"
And they parted&mdash;the one going east, and the other west&mdash;and
were lost in the darkness of night.</p>

<p>It was now past seven, with a clear, frosty night. What
was to be done? It was manifest that the cave was betrayed&mdash;at
least, that the <i>whereabouts</i> was known&mdash;and it
was likewise necessary that this information should be
conveyed to the poor inmate. But where was he to find a
refuge, after the cave had been vacated? It struck them, in
consulting, that if they could get the old woman to be
friendly and assisting, the escape might be effected before
the time evidently fixed upon for taking the cave by surprise.
This was, however, a somewhat dangerous experiment; for,
although Tibby M'Murdo was known to be favourable&mdash;as
who amongst the lower classes was not?&mdash;to the non-conformists,
yet she might not choose to run the immense risk of
ruin and even death, which might result from her knowingly
giving harbour to a rebel. So, by way of sounding the old
woman&mdash;who lived in the house by herself, her granddaughter,
who was at service in the town, only visiting her
occasionally&mdash;they proposed to stay all night in the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
as they were in hourly expectation of a wool-dealer who
had made an appointment to meet them here, but who,
owing to the heavy roads, had manifestly been detained beyond
the appointed time. The old woman had various objections
to this arrangement; but was at last persuaded to
make an addition to her fire, to put half-a-dozen bottles of her
best ale on the table, with a tappit hen, and what she termed
"a wee drap o' the creature," and to retire to rest about
eight o'clock, her usual hour, they having already paid for
all, and promised not to leave the house till she rose in the
morning. At this time, about eight o'clock, the night had
suddenly became dark and cloudy, and there was a strange
noise up amongst the rocks overhead. It was manifest
that there was a change of weather fast approaching. At
last the snow descended, the wind arose, and it became a
perfect tempest. Next morning, there were three human
beings in Tibby's small <i>ben</i>, busily employed in discussing
the good things already purchased, as well as in higgling
and bothering about the price of wool. The weather,
which had been exceedingly boisterous all night, had again
cleared up into frost, and the inhabitants of Monyaive
were busied in cutting away the accumulated snow from
their doors, when in burst old Tibby's granddaughter, and,
all at once, with exceeding animation, made the following
communication:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, granny, ye never heard what has taen place this
last nicht. I had it a' frae Jock Johnston. Ye ken Jock&mdash;he's
oor maister's foreman, an' unco weel acquent wi' the
dragoons that lodge in the Spread Eagle. Weel, Jock tells
me that Lag was here last nicht, in disguise like, an' that
they had gotten information, frae ane o' their spies like,
aboot a cave up by yonder where some o' the puir persecuted
folks is concealed; an' that, aboot ane o'clock o' this morning&mdash;an'
an awsome morning it was&mdash;they had marched on,
three abreast, through the drift, carrying strae alang wi'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
them an lighted matches; an' that they gaed straight to the
cave, an' immediately summoned the puir folks to come out
and be shot; and that they only answered by a groan,
which tellt them as plainly as could be, that the puir creatures
were there; and that they immediately set fire to the
straes at the mooth o' the cave, and fairly smoked them
(Jock tells me) to death. Did ye ever hear the like
o't?"</p>

<p>"O woman!" responded the grandmother, "but that is
fearfu'!&mdash;these are indeed fearfu' times; there is naebody
sure o' their lives for half-an-hour thegither, wha doesna gae
to hear the fushionless curates!"</p>

<p>At this instant, one of the dragoons drew up his horse
at the door, asking if a man, such as he described, with a
blue bonnet and a grey duffle coat, had returned late last
night, or rather this morning, to bed. Old Tibby answered,
in a quavering voice, that the man mentioned had left her
house about eight o'clock, and had not yet returned. The
dragoon appeared somewhat incredulous; and, giving his
horse to the girl to hold, he dashed at once and boldly
into the room, where the three persons already mentioned
were seated. The young farmers questioned immediately
the propriety of his conduct; but he drew his
sword, and swore that he would make cats' meat of the first
that should lay hold upon him. He had no sooner said so,
than a man sprang upon him from the fireside, and, striking
his sword-arm down with the poker, immediately
secured his person by such means as the place and time
presented. The fellow roared like a bull, blaspheming and
vociferating mightily of the crime of arresting a king's
soldier in the discharge of his duty. But he was hurried
into a concealed bed, tied firmly down with ropes and even
blankets, and made to know that, unless he was silent, he
might have to pay for his disobedience with his life.
When old Tibby saw how things were going on, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
her house might suffer by such transactions, she sallied
forth as fast as her feeble limbs and well-worn staff would
carry her, exclaiming as she went&mdash;"We'll a' be slain&mdash;we'll
a' be slain!&mdash;the laird o' Lag will be here&mdash;and
Clavers will be here&mdash;and the King himself will be here&mdash;an'
we'll a' be murdered&mdash;we'll a' be murdered!" At this
moment, the trooper appeared in his regimentals, mounted
his horse, and was off at full gallop. The granddaughter,
now relieved from holding the dragoon's horse, followed
her grandmother, and brought her lamp to the house; but,
to their infinite surprise, there was nobody there save the
very cursing trooper whom she had seen so recently ride
off. His voice was loud, and his complainings fearful; but
neither Tibby nor her granddaughter durst go near him, as
they were fully convinced that he was a devil, and no man,
since he had the power at once of mounting a horse and
flying rather than riding away, and, at the same time, of
lying cursing and swearing in a press bed in the <i>ben</i>. At
last a neighbour heard the tale, and, being less superstitions,
relieved the unfortunate prisoner from his rather awkward
predicament. He swore revenge, and to cut poor old Tibby
into two with his sword; but he found, upon searching for
his weapon, that it was absent, as well as his clothes, which
had been forcibly stripped from him when he was tied&mdash;and
that without leave&mdash;and that he had nothing for it
but to thrust himself into canonicals&mdash;in which garb he
actually walked home to his quarters, amidst the shouts of
his companions, and to the astonishment of all the staring
villagers.</p>

<p>As he was making the best of his way to hide his disgrace
in the Spread Eagle, he was told that his commanding officer,
Sir Robert Grierson, had been wishing to speak with him,
for some time past. Upon appearing immediately in the
presence of authority, he was questioned in regard to the
mission on which he had been despatched, and was scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
credited when he narrated the treatment which he had
met with, and the loss which he had sustained. A detachment
was immediately despatched in quest of the thief,
the <i>wool-merchant</i>, who had so cleverly supplied himself
with a passport from the king; and, after our soldier's person
had been unrobed, and attired for the present in his
stable undress, Lag set out with a few followers, to examine
the cave, in order to be assured of Mr Lawson's death.
"They may gallop off with our horses," said Lag, in a jocular
manner, by the way; "but they will not easily gallop off
with the old choked hound, who has led us so many dances
over the hills of Queensberry and Auchenleck." At last,
they arrived at the mouth of the cave, and entered. Black
and blue, and severely bruised, lay the dead body before
them. "Ah, ha!" said Lag, making his boot, as he expressed
it, acquainted with old Canticle's posteriors. "Ah, ha! my
fleet bird of the mountain, and we have caught you at
last, and caught you <i>napping</i>&mdash;ha, ha! Why don't you speak,
old fire and brimstone? What! not a word now!&mdash;and yet
you had plenty when you preached from the Gouk Thorn,
to upwards of two thousand of your prick-eared, purse-mouthed,
canting followers. Come, my lads, we have less
work to do now; we will e'en back to quarters, and drink a
safe voyage into the Holy Land, to old Dumb-and-flat there!"
So saying, he reined up his horse, and was on the point of
withdrawing the men, when one of them, who had eyed
the body, which was imperfectly seen in the dark cave,
more nearly than the rest, exclaimed&mdash;"And, by the Lord
Harry, and we are all at fault, and the game is off, on four
living legs, after all&mdash;off and away! and we standing
drivelling here, when we should be many miles off in hot
pursuit of this cunning fox who has contrived to give us
the slip once more."</p>

<p>"What means the idiot?" vociferated Grierson.</p>

<p>"Mean!&mdash;why, what should I mean, Sir Robert, but that
this here piece of carrion is no more the stinking corpse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of old Closeburn, than I am a son of the Covenant!"</p>

<p>It turned out, upon investigation, that this was the body
of the informer Watson, who had preceded Lag to the
cave during the terrible drift; had been observed by John
Harkness and Sandy Gibson, who were then employed in
removing Lawson to the small inn; and, after a drubbing
which disabled him from moving, he had been left the
only tenant of the cave. When Grierson came, as above
mentioned, from the drift and the cold, as well as the beating,
he was unable to speak; but his groans brought his
miserable death upon him; and Lawson, by assuming the
dragoon's garb and steed, was enabled to escape, and to
officiate, as has been already mentioned in a former paper,
for several years before his death, in his own church, from
which he had been so long and so unjustly driven. Thus
did it please God to punish the infamous conduct of
Watson, and to enable his own servant to effect his escape.
The dragoon's horse was found, one morning at day-light,
neighing and beating the hoof at old Tibby's door. It
soon found an owner, but told no stories respecting its late
occupant, who was now snugly lodged in William Graham's
parlour in the guid town of Kendal. Graham and he were
cousins-german.</p>


<hr style="width: 15%;" />
<h3><a name="THE_VIOLATED_COFFIN" id="THE_VIOLATED_COFFIN"></a>XVII.  &mdash;THE VIOLATED COFFIN.</h3>

<p>An effort has, of late, been made to repel the allegations
which, for past ages, have been made against the infamous
instruments of cruelty during the twenty-eight years' persecution.
The Covenanters have been represented as factious
democrats, setting at defiance all constituted authority,
and exposing themselves to the vengeance of law and
justice. These sentiments are apt to identify themselves
with modern politics; but we hope we will never see our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
country again devastated by oppression, cruelty, and all the
shootings, and headings, and hangings of the Stuart despotism
repeated. It becomes, therefore, the duty of every
friend of good and equal government to put his hand to
the work, and to support those principles under which Britain
has flourished so long, and every man has sat in safety
and in peace under his own vine and his own fig-tree. No
train of reasoning, or of demonstration, however, will suffice
for this. The judgment is, in many occasions, convinced
of error and injustice, whilst the heart and the conduct
remain the same. There must be something in accordance
with the decisions of the judgment pressed home upon the
feelings. There must be vivid pictures of the workings of
a system of misrule placed before the mind's eye, so that a
deep and a human interest may be felt in the picture. The
reader must open the doors of our suffering peasantry, and
witness their family and fireside bereavements. He must become
their companion under the snow-wreath and the damp
cave&mdash;he must mount the scaffold with them, and even
listen to their last act and testimony. How vast is the
impression which a painter can, in this way, make upon the
spirit of the spectator! Let Allan's famous Circassian slave
be an instance in point; but the painter is limited to a
single point of time, and the relation which that bears and
exhibits to what has gone before or will come after; but
the writer of narrative possesses the power of shifting his
telescope from eminence to eminence&mdash;of varying, <i>ad libitum</i>,
time, place, and circumstances&mdash;and thus of making up for
the acknowledged inferiority of written description of narratives
to what is submitted, as Horace says, "<i>Oculis fidelibus</i>,"
by his vast and unlimited power of variety. The
means, therefore, by which past generations have been
made to feel and acknowledge the inhumanities, the scandalous
atrocities of those blood-stained times, still remain
subservient to their original and long tried purposes; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it becomes the imperious duty of every succeeding age to
transmit and perpetuate the impressions of abhorrence with
which those times were regarded and recollected. This
duty, too, becomes so much the more necessary, as the times
become the more remote. The object which is rapidly
passed and distanced by the speed of the steam-engine,
does not more naturally diminish in dimensions to the eye,
as it recedes into the depths of distance, than do the events
which, in passing, figured largely and impressively, lose
their bulk and their interest when removed from us by the
dim and darkening interval of successive centuries; and the
only method by which their natural and universal law can
be modified, or in any degree counteracted, is by a continuous
and uninterrupted reference to the past&mdash;by making
what is old, recent by description and imagination; and
by more carefully tracing and acknowledging the connection
which past agents and times have, or may be supposed
to have, upon the present advancement and happiness of
man. Had the devotedness of the Covenanter and Nonconformist
been less entire than it was&mdash;had the arbitrary
desires of a bigoted priesthood and a tyrant prince been
submitted to&mdash;then had the Duke of York been king to the
end of his days&mdash;Rome had again triumphed in her priesthood;
and we at this hour, if at all awakened from the
influence of surrounding advancement to a sense of our
degradation, had been only enacting bloody Reformation,
instead of bloodless Reform, and suffering the incalculable
miseries which our forefathers, centuries ago, anticipated.
Nay, more, but for the lesson taught us by the friends of
the Covenant and the conventicle, where had been the
great encouragement to resist political oppression in all
time to come, when the proudly elevated finger may point to
the record, which said, and still says, in letters indeed of
blood&mdash;"A people resolved to be free, can never be ultimately
enslaved." The Covenant had its use&mdash;and, immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in its own day, and in its immediate efforts, it placed
William, and law, and freedom on the throne of Britain;
but that is as nothing in the balance, when compared with
the less visible and more remote effects of this distinguished
triumph:&mdash;It, throughout all the last century, maintained
a firm and unyielding struggle with despotism, sometimes
indeed worsted, but never altogether subdued; and it has,
of late years, issued in events and triumphs too recent and
too agitating to be now fairly and fully discussed. Nor
will the influence of the Covenant cease to be felt in our
land, till God shall have deserted her, and left her entirely
to the freedom of her own will, to the debasing
influence of that luxury and corruption which has formed
the grave of every kingdom that has yet lived out its
limited period.</p>

<p>These Gleanings of the Covenant have been written
under the impression, and with the view above expressed;
and it is hoped that the following narrative, true in all its
leading circumstances, and more than true in the "vraisemblable,"
may contribute something to the object thus distinctly
stated.</p>

<p>The funeral of Thomas Thomson had advanced from the
Gaitend to the Lakehead. The accompaniment was numerous&mdash;the
group was denser. Thomas had lived respected,
and died regretted. He was the father of five
helpless children, all females, and his wife was manifestly
about to be delivered of a sixth. Just as the procession had
advanced to the house of Will Coultart, a troop of ten men
rode up. They had evidently been drinking, and spoke not
only blasphemously, but in terms of intimidation.&mdash;"Stop,
you cursed crew," said the leader. "He has escaped law,
but he shall not escape justice. Come here, lad;" and
at once they alighted from their horses, seized the coffin,
and opening the lid, were about to penetrate the corpse
through and through. "Stop a little," said John Ferguson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the famous souter of Closeburn; "there are maybe twa at
a bargain-making;" so saying, he lifted an axe which he
took up at a wright's door, and dared any one to disturb
them in their Christian duty. A "pell-mell" took place, in
the midst of which poor Ferguson was killed. He had two
sons in the company, who, seeing how their father had been
used, rushed upon the dragoons, and were both of them
severely wounded. In the meantime, Douglas of Drumlanrig
came up, and, understanding how things went, ordered
the soldiers to give in, and the wounded men to be taken
care off. All this was wondrous well; but what follows is
not so. The body of Ferguson was carried to Croalchapel;
and the two sons accompanied it, with many tears. Douglas
seemed to feel what had happened, and could not avoid
accompanying the party home. He entered the house of
mourning, where there was a dead father, a weeping widow,
and two wounded sons. He entered, but he saw nothing
but Peggy. Poor Peggy was an only sister of these lads&mdash;an
only daughter of her murdered father. Douglas was a
man of the world! Oh, my God, what a term that is! and
how much misery and horror does it not contain. Peggy was
really beautiful; not like Georgina Gordon, or Lady William,
or Mrs Norton, or Lady Blessington; for her beauty
depended in no degree upon art. Had you arrayed her in
rags, and placed her in a poor's-house, she would have appeared
to advantage. Peggy, too, (the God who made her
knows,) was pure in soul, and innocent in act as is the
angel Gabriel! she never once thought of sinning, as a
woman may, and does (sometimes) sin; she lived for her
father, whom she loved&mdash;and for her mother, whom she did
not greatly dislike. But her mother was a stepmother, and
Peggy liked her father. Guess, then, her grief, when Peggy
saw her father murdered, her brothers wounded, and knew
the cause thereof. "Lift her," said Douglas to his men, after
he had, in seeming humanity, seen the corpse and brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
home; "lift her into Red Hob's saddle, and carry her to
Drumlanrig." No sooner said than done. The weeping,
screaming girl was lifted into the saddle, and conveyed, per
force, to Drumlanrig. At that gate there stood a figure
clothed in dyed garments. It was the elder brother of
Peggy, he who had been least injured of the two. He stood
with his sword in his hand, and dared any one who would
conduct his sister into the abode of dishonour. Douglas
snapped, and then fired a pistol at him, but neither took
effect. In the meantime, the brother was secured, and the
sister was carried into the "Blue Room," well known afterwards
as the infamous sleeping-chamber of old "Q." The
not less infamous, though ultimately repentant Douglas,
advanced into the chamber. The poor girl seemed as if she
had seen a snake; she shrunk from his approach and from
his blandishments. She had previously opened the window
into the green walk; she had taken her resolve, and, in a
few instants, lay a maimed, almost mangled being, on the
beautiful walks of Drumlanrig. Douglas was manifestly
struck by the incident, but not converted. He took sufficient
care to have the poor girl conveyed home, and to have the brothers
provided for, but his hour was not yet come. It was
not till after his frequent conversations with the minister of
Closeburn, that he came to a proper sense of his horrible
conduct. But what was the awful devastation of this
family. The poor beauteous flower Peggy, who was about
to have been married to a farmer's son, (Kirkpatrick of
Auchincairn,) was by him rejected. He called at the house
sometime afterwards, with a view to see her; but he came
full of suspicion, and therefore unwilling to receive the
truth. He had heard the whole story, and must have known
that his Peggy was at least as pure in mind as she had been
beautiful in person; but he belonged not naturally to the
noble stock of the family to which he was to have been
allied, and gave himself up to prejudice. The girl was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in bed, to which, from her bruises, she had been confined for
months. The meeting might have been one which a poet
would have gloried in describing, or a painter in delineating
and embellishing, with hues stolen from the arc of Heaven!
Alas! it was one only worthy of the pencil of a Ribera&mdash;fraught
with cruelty, and abounding in selfishness and dishonour.
The girl, as she turned her pale yet beautiful face
on him, told him the truth, and watched, with tears in her
eyes, the effect of her narrative on one whose image had
never been absent from her mind, if indeed it had not supported
her in her struggle, and nerved her to the purpose
which preferred death to dishonour. Her bruises and
wounds spoke for her, and, to any one but her lover, would
have proved that he was a part of the object of her sacrifice.
It was all to no purpose. The eloquence of truth, of
love, of nature, were lost upon him; nothing would persuade
him that the object of his love had not been degraded.
He turned a cold glance of doubt upon her, and
turned to leave the room. Peggy rushed out of bed, and,
maimed and weak as she was, would have stopped him.
Her energies failed her&mdash;her lover was gone; and her
mother, roused by the cries of her pain, came and assisted
her again into bed. Poor Peggy heard no more of Kirkpatrick.
She sickened and died?&mdash;no! far worse!&mdash;she
became desperate, married a blackguard, and lived a drunkard;
the sons were banished for firing at Douglas, as he
passed in his carriage through Thornhill; and the poor
mother of the whole family became&mdash;shall I tell it I&mdash;an object
of charity! Thus was, to my certain knowledge, at
least to that of my ancestors, a most creditable and well-doing
family ruined, root and branch, by the persecutors&mdash;or,
in other words, by those who, without knowing what
they did, regarded the "Covenant" as an unholy thing,
and fought the foremost in the ranks of oppression and
uniformity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, there is not a word of this in Woodrow, or Burns,
or even in the MS. of the Advocate's Library; and yet we
can assure the reader, that the material facts are as true
as is the death of Darnley, or the murder of Rizzio! God
bless you, madam! you have, and can have, and ought to
have no notion whatever of the united current of <i>horribility</i>,
which ran through the whole ocean of cruelty during these
awful and most terrific times! May the God that made,
the Saviour that redeemed, and the Holy Spirit that prepares
us for heaven, make us thankful that in <i>those times</i> we
do not live; and that such men as Woodrow and Burns
(the first and the last) have been raised up, to vindicate and
to justify such men as then suffered in their families, or in
their persons, for the covenanted cause of the Great Head
of our Presbyterian Church!</p>

<h2>THE SURGEON'S TALES.</h2>

<h3>THE MONOMANIAC.</h3>


<p>In some of my prior papers, I have had occasion to make
some oblique references to that disease called <i>pseudoblepsis
imaginaria</i>&mdash;in other words, a vision of objects not present.
Cullen places it among local diseases, as one of a depraved
action of the organs contributing to vision; "whereby, of
course, he would disjoin it from those cases of madness
where a depraved action of the brain itself produces the
same effect. In this, Cullen displays his ordinary acuteness;
for we see many instances where there is a fancied
vision of objects not present, without insanity; and, indeed,
the whole doctrine of spirits has latterly been founded on
this distinction.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> From the very intimate connection, however,
which exists between the visual organs and the brain
itself, it must always be a matter of great difficulty&mdash;if indeed,
in many cases, it be not entirely impossible&mdash;to
make the distinction available; for there are cases&mdash;such as
that of the conscience-spectre, and those that generally
depend upon thoughts and feelings of more than ordinary
intensity&mdash;that seem to lie between the two extremes of
merely diseased visual organs and diseased brains; and, in
so far as my experience goes, I am free to say that I have
seen more cases of imaginary visions of distant objects, resulting
from some terrible excitement of the emotions, than
from the better defined causes set forth by the medical
writers. Among the passions and emotions, again, that in
their undue influence over the sane condition of the mind,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>are most likely to give rise to the diseased vision of <i>phantasmata</i>,
I would be inclined to place that which usually
exerts so much absorbing power over the young female
heart. The cause lies on the surface. In the case of the
passions&mdash;of anger, revenge, fear, and so forth&mdash;the feeling
generally works itself out; and, in many cases, the object
is so unpleasant that the mind seeks relief from it, and flies
it; while, in the emotions of love, there is a morbid brooding
over the cherished image that takes hold of the fancy;
the object is called up by the spell of the passion placed before
the mind's eye, and held there for hours, days, and
years, till the image becomes almost a stationary impression,
and is invested with all the attributes of a real presence.
I do not feel that I would be justified in saying
that I am able to substantiate the remark I have now made
by many cases falling under my own observation; the examples
of <i>monomania</i> in sane persons are not very often to
be met with; and I have heard many of my professional
brethren say, that they never experienced a single instance
in all their practice.</p>

<p>The case I am now to detail, occurred within two miles
of the town of &mdash;&mdash;. The patient was a lady, Mrs C&mdash;&mdash;,
an individual of a nervous, irritable temperament, and possessed
of a glowing fancy, that, against her will, brought up
by-past scenes with a distinctness that was painful to her.
She had lately returned from India, whither she had accompanied
her husband, whom she left buried in a deep,
watery grave in the channel of the Mozambique. I had
been attending her for a nervous ailment, which had shattered
her frame terribly, while it increased the powers of
her creative fancy, as well as the sensibility by which the
mental images were invested with their chief powers over
her. She suffered also from a tenderness in the <i>retina</i>,
which forced her to shun the light. How this latter complaint
was associated with the other, I cannot explain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
unless upon the principle which regulates the connection
between the sensibility of the eye and the heated brains
of those who labour under inflammation of that organ. I
was informed by her mother, Mrs L&mdash;&mdash;, as well as her
sister, that she had come from India a perfect wreck, both
of mind and body; and, for a period of eighteen months
afterwards, could scarcely be prevailed upon to see any of
her friends&mdash;shutting herself up for whole days in her
room, the windows of which were kept dark, to prevent the
light, which operated like a sharp sting, from falling upon
her irritable eyes. It was chiefly with a view to the removal
of this opthalmic affection, that I was requested to visit
her; and I could very soon perceive, that the visionary
state of her mind was closely connected with the habit
of dark seclusion to which she was necessitated to resort,
for the purpose of avoiding the pain produced by the rays
of the sun. On my first interview, I found her sitting alone
in the darkened room, brooding over thoughts that seemed
to exert a strong influence over her; but she soon joined
me in a conversation which, diverging from the subject of
her complaint, embraced topics that brought out the peculiarity
of her mind&mdash;a strong enthusiastic power of portraying
scenes of grief which she had witnessed, and which, as
she proceeded, seemed to rise before her with almost the
vividness of presence; yet, with her, judgment was as strong
and healthy as that of any day-dreamer among the wide
class of mute poets, of whom there are more in the world
than of philosophers.</p>

<p>I could not detect properly her ailment, and resolved to
question her mother alone.</p>

<p>"Did you not notice anything peculiar about my daughter?"
she said.</p>

<p>"The love of a shaded room, resulting from an irritability
in the organs of sight, is to me no great rarity," I replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Though her fit has not been upon her," rejoined she,
with an air of melancholy, "it is not an hour gone since her
scream rung shrilly through this house, as if she had been
in the hands of fiends; and, to be plain with you, I left you
to discover yourself what may be too soon apparent. I fear
for her mind, sir."</p>

<p>"I have seen no reason for the apprehension; but her
scream, was it not bodily pain?"</p>

<p>"I could wish that it had been mere bodily pain; but it
was not. You have not heard Isabella's history," she continued,
in a low, whispering tone. "She has experienced
what might have turned the brain of any one. I discovered
something extraordinary in her about six months ago. One
evening, when the candles were shaded for the relief of her
eyes, and I and Maria were sitting by her, she stopped suddenly
in the midst of our conversation, and sat gazing intensely
at something between her and the wall; pointing
out her finger, her mouth open, and scarcely drawing her
breath. I was terror-struck; for the idea immediately
rushed into my mind, that it was a symptom of insanity;
but I had no time for thought&mdash;a scream burst from her,
and she fell at my feet in a faint. When she recovered, she
told us that she had seen, in the shaded light of the candle,
which assumed the blue tinge of the moonlight, the figure
of a dead body sitting upright in the waters, with the sailcloth
in which he was committed to the deep wrapped
around him, and his pale face directed towards her. At
the recollection of the vision, she shuddered, would not
recur to the subject again, but betrayed otherwise no
wandering of the fancy. Several times since, the same
object has presented itself to her; and, what is extraordinary,
it is always when the candle is shaded; yet she
exhibits the same judgment, and I could never detect
the slightest indication of a defect in the workings of
her mind. I sent for you to treat her eyes, and left it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to you to see if you could discover any symptoms of a
diseased mind."</p>

<p>"Was the object she thus supposes present to her, ever
exposed in reality to the true waking sense?" said I, suspecting
a case of <i>monomania</i>.</p>

<p>"Did she not tell you?" rejoined she. "Come."</p>

<p>And leading me again into her daughter's darkened
apartment, she whispered something in her ear, retired, and
left us together.</p>

<p>"Your mother informs, me, madam," said I, "that you
have seen <i>what exists not</i>; and I am anxious, from professional
reasons, to know from yourself whether I am to attribute
it to the creative powers of an active fancy, or to an
affection of the visual organs, that I have read more of than
I have witnessed."</p>

<p>She started, and I saw I had touched a tender part&mdash;probably
that connected with her own suspicions that her
mother and sister deemed her insane.</p>

<p>"It was for this purpose, then, that you have been called
to see me?" she replied, hastily. "It is well; I shall be
tested by one who at least is not prejudiced. My mother
and sister think that I am deranged. I need not tell you
that I consider myself sane, although I confess that this
illusion of the sense, to which I am subjected, makes me
sometimes suspicious of myself. Will you listen to my
story?"</p>

<p>I replied that I would; and thus she began:&mdash;</p>

<p>Experience, sir, is a world merely to those who live in
it&mdash;it exists not&mdash;its laws cannot be communicated to the
heart of youth; the transfusion of the blood of the aged
into the veins of the young to produce wisdom, is not more
vain than the displacing of the hopes of the young mind
by the cold maxims of what man has felt, trembled to feel,
and wished he could have anticipated, that he might have
been prepared for it. Such has ever been, such is, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
will ever be, the history of the sons and daughters of Adam.
What but the changes into which I&mdash;still comparatively a
young woman&mdash;have passed&mdash;not, it would almost seem,
mutations of the same principle, but rather new states of
existence&mdash;could have wrung from a heart, where hope
should still have lighted her lamp, and illuminated my
paths, these sentiments of a dearly purchased experience?
When I and George Cunningham, my schoolfellow, my first
and last lover, and subsequently my husband, passed those
brilliant days of youth's sunshine among the green holms
and shaggy dells of &mdash;&mdash;; following the same pursuits&mdash;conning
the same lessons&mdash;indulging in the same dreams of
future happiness, and training each other's hearts into a
community of feeling and sentiment, till we seemed one
being, actuated by the same living principle: in how happy
a state of ignorance of those changes that awaited me in the
world, did I exist? I would fall into the hackneyed strain of
artificial fiction writing, were I to portray the pleasures of
a companionship and love that had its beginning in the very
first impulses of feeling; with a view to set off by contrast
the subsequent events that awaited us, when our happiness
should have been realized.</p>

<p>When a woman of sensibility says she loves a man, she
has told, through a medium that works out the conditions
of the responding powers of our common nature, the heart,
more than all the eulogistic eloquence of the tongue could
achieve, to show the estimate she forms of the qualities of
the object of her affections; but when she adds that that
love originated in the friendship of children, grew with the
increase of the powers of mind and body, and entered as a
part into every feeling that actuated the young hearts, she
has expressed the terms of an endearment so pure, tender,
exclusive, and lasting, that it transcends all the ordinary
forms of the communion of spirits on earth. The attachment
is different from all others&mdash;it stands by itself; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to endeavour to conceive its purity and force by any factitious
mixture of friendship, and the ordinary endearments of
limited time and favourable circumstances of meeting, would
be as vain as all hypothetical investigation into the nature of
feeling must ever be. I cannot tell when I first knew the
young man whose name I have mentioned under an emotion
that shakes my frame; the syllables were a part of my early
lispings, and I cannot yet think that they are unconnected
with a being that has now no local habitation upon earth.
Our parents were intimate neighbours; and the woods and
waters of &mdash;&mdash;, if their voices&mdash;sweeter than articulated intelligence&mdash;could
imitate the accents of man, would tell best
when they wooed us into that communion, which they cherished,
and witnessed, with an apparent participation of our
joy, to open into an early affection. The power of mutual objects
of pleasure and interest, especially if they are a part
of the lovely province of nature&mdash;the rural landscape,
secluded and secreted from the eyes of all the world besides,
with its dells and fountains, birds and flowers&mdash;in increasing
the attachment of young hearts, has been often observed
and described; but we felt it. These inanimate objects are
generally, and were to us, not only a tie, but they shared a
part of our love, as if in some mysterious way they had become
connected with, and a part of us. The often imputed
association of ideas is a poor and inadequate solution of this
work of nature: it is the effect put for the cause; the common,
boasted philosophy of man, who invents terms of
familiar sound to explain secrets eternally hidden from him.
If we who felt, as few have ever felt, the influence of these
green, umbrageous shades&mdash;with their nut-trees, bushes,
flowers, and gowany leas; their singing birds, and nests
with speckled eggs; their half-concealed fountains of limpid
water, and running streams, and beds of white pebbles&mdash;in
nourishing and increasing our young loves, could not
tell how or why they were invested with such power; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
philosopher, I deem, may resign the task, and say, with a
sigh, that it was nature, and nature alone, who did all this;
and the secret will remain unexplained.</p>

<p>We enjoyed ten years of this intercourse&mdash;I calculate from
the fifth to the fifteenth year of our youth&mdash;and every one
of these years, as it evolved the ripening powers of our
minds, so it strengthened the mingling affections of our
hearts. We became lovers long before we knew the sanctions
and rights, and duties of pledged faith; we were each
other's by a troth, a thousand times spoken; exchanged and
felt in the throbbing embrace, the burning sighs, and the
eloquent looks, that were but the natural impulses of a feeling
we rejoiced in, yet scarcely comprehended. My heart,
recoiling from the thoughts of after years, luxuriates in the
memory of these blissful hours; and, were not the theme
exhausted a thousand times by the eloquence of rapt feeling,
speaking with the tongue of inspiration, I could dwell
on these early rejoicings of unsullied spirits for ever.</p>

<p>My dream was not scattered&mdash;it was only changed in its
form and hues, when my youthful betrothed was removed
from home, to go through a course of navigation to fit him for
the service of the sea, to which the intentions of his father,
and his own early wishes, led him. I could have doubted my
existence sooner than the faith of his heart; and he was
only gone to make those preparations for attaining a position
in society that would enable him to realize those fond
and bright prospects we had indulged in contemplating
among the woods that resounded to pledges exchanged in
the face of heaven. The first place of his destination was
London, from whence, for a period of about three years,
I heard from him regularly by letters, which breathed with
an increased warmth the same sentiments we had repeated
and interchanged so often during the long period of our
prior intercourse. Some time after this, he sailed to India;
then were my thoughts first tinged by the changing hues of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
solitude; and my hopes and fears bound to the wayward
circumstances of a world which had as yet been to me a
paradise.</p>

<p>I heard nothing from him for two long years after he left
London. A portrayment of my thoughts during that
period would be a thousand times more difficult than for
the painter to seize and represent the changing hues of the
gem that, thrown on a tropic strand, reflects the endless
hues of the earth and sky. I trembled and hoped by turns
but every idea and every feeling were so strongly mingled
with reminiscences of former pleasures, the prospects of
future happiness, the fears of a change in his affections, or
of his death, that I could not pronounce my mind as being,
at any given moment, aught but a medium of impressions
that I could not seize or fix, so as to contemplate myself.
All I can say is, that he was the presiding genius of every
emotion with which my heart was influenced; and, to
those who have loved, that may be sufficient to shew the
utter devotion of every pulse of my being to the deified
image enshrined within my bosom. Now came the period
of the realizing of my dreams. George Cunninghame came
back, and married me.</p>

<p>We had scarcely been two months married when my
husband, whom I loved more and more every day, got, by
the influence of powerful friends, the command of a large
vessel&mdash;the <i>Griffin</i>&mdash;engaged in the trade to India. It was
arranged that I should accompany him, that, as we had
been associated from our earliest infancy, (our separation
had been only that of the body, and interfered not with the
union of the immaterial essence), we should still be together.
In this resolution I rejoiced; and, though by
nature a coward, my love overcame all my terrors of the
great deep. The day was fixed for our departure. A lady
passenger and two servants were to go with us to the Cape,
from whose society I expected pleasure; and every preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
which love could suggest was made to render me
happy. We left the Downs on a calm day of December,
and went down the Channel with a rattling gale from the
north. Life on board of an Indiaman has been a thousand
times described; and, would to heaven I had nothing to
detail but the ordinary conduct of civilized men! Our
chief officer was one Crawley, and our second a person of
the name of Buist&mdash;the only individual my husband had
no confidence in being Hans Kreutz, the steward, a German,
who was whispered to have been engaged as a maritime
venatic, or pirate, in the West Indies: and, if any man's
character might be detected in his countenance, this
foreigner's disposition might have been read in lineaments
marked by the graver of passion. Part of what I
have now said may have been the result of after experience;
yet I could perceive shadowings of evil at this time,
which I had not the knowledge of human nature to enable
me to turn to any account.</p>

<p>With a series of gentle breezes and fine weather, we came
to the Cape, where Mrs Hardy and her two servants were
put ashore. One of the servants had agreed to accompany
me to Madras, and was to have come on board again, to join
us, before we left Table Bay. Whether she had changed
her mind, or been detained by some unforeseen cause, I know
not, but the boat came off without her; and all the information
that I could get was, that she was not to be found.
I trembled to be left on board of a vessel without a female
companion, and strongly insisted upon George to delay his
departure until another effort should be made to endeavour
to find a servant in Cape Town; but, a favourable wind
having sprung up at that moment, Crawley remonstrated, in
his peculiar mode of abject petitioning; and my husband,
having himself seen the advantage of seizing the favourable
opportunity for taking and accomplishing the passage of the
Mozambique, we departed, under a stiff gale; and, in a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
time, reached the middle of that famous Channel, where the
fears of the seamen have been so often excited by the reputed
cannibalism of the natives of Madagascar. At this
time I was strangely beset by nightly visions of terror,
which I could impute to no other cause than the stories that
George had repeated to me of the wild character of these
savages. During the day, but more especially during the
blue, sulphurous, flame-coloured twilight of that region&mdash;I
often fixed my eye on the long, dark, umbrageous coast&mdash;followed
the ranges of receding heights&mdash;threaded the deep
recesses of the valleys, that seemed to end in dark caves, and
peopled every haunt with festive savages performing their
unholy rites over a human victim, destined to form food for
creatures bearing that external impress of God's finger which
marks the lords of the creation. Those visions were always
connected, in some way, with myself; and I could not
banish the idea, which clung to me with a morbid power of
adherence, that I might, alone and unprotected, be cast
into some of these cimmerian recesses, and be subjected to
the unutterable miseries of a fate a thousand times worse
than death, and what might follow death, by the usages of
of eaters of human beings. There was no cause for any such
apprehensions; and I am now satisfied that these dark creations
of my fancy were in some mysterious way connected
with a disordered state of my physical economy; but I was
not then aware of such predisposing causes of mental gloom,
and still brooded over my imagined horrors, till I drove rest
and sleep from my pillow, and disturbed my husband with
my pictured images of a danger that he said was far removed
from me. From him I got some support and relief;
but the faces of the men I saw around me, and especially
those of Crawley and Kreutz, seemed, to me, rather to reflect
a corroboration of my fears, than to afford me encouragement
and support. The grim visions retained their
power over me; and, the wind having fallen off almost to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
dead calm, I found myself fixed in the very midst of the
scenes that thus nourished and perpetuated them. The depression
of mind produced by these frightful day-dreams and
nightmares, made me sickly and weak. I could scarcely
take any food; every piece of flesh presented to me, reminded
me of the feasts of the inhabitants of that dark, dismal island
that lay stretching before me in the vapours of a tropical
climate, like a land of enchantment called up by fiends from
the great deep; the dyspeptic nausea of sickness was the very
food of my gloomy thoughts; and the co-operative powers
of mind and body tended to the increase of my misery, till
I seemed a victim of confirmed hypochondria.</p>

<p>We were still fixed immovably in the same place: all
motive powers seemed to have forsaken the elements&mdash;the
sea was like a sheet of glass, the sails hung loose from
the masts, and the men lay listless about, overcome with
heat, and yawning in lethargy. It was impossible to keep
me below. I required air to keep me breathing, and felt a
strange melancholy relief from fixing my eyes on the very
scene of my terrors. Every effort to occupy my mind was
vain; and I lay, for hours at a time, with my eyes fixed on
the shore, piercing the deep, wooded hollows, following the
faint traces of the savages as they disappeared among the
thick trees, and investing every naked demon with all the
characteristics of the followers of the mysterious midnight
rites in which I conceived they engaged when the hour of
their orgies came. I often saw individuals&mdash;rendered
gigantic by the magnifying medium of the thick vapour&mdash;come
down to the beach, and fix their gaze on us for a time,
and then pace back again to the wooded recesses. Sometimes,
when unable to sleep, I crept up from the cabin, and sat
and surveyed the silent scene around me&mdash;the hazy moon,
throwing her thick beams over the calm sea&mdash;the dark shadows
of unknown birds sailing slowly through the air, and
uttering at intervals sounds I had never heard before&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
fires of the inhabitants among the trees on the coast, that sent
up a long column of red light through the atmosphere, and exhibited
the flitting bodies of the naked beings as they danced
round the objects of their rites. It is impossible for me, by
any language of which I have the power, to convey an adequate
conception of my feelings during these hours. They
were realities to me; and, therefore, whatever may be said
against fanciful creations, I have a right to claim attention
to states of the mind and feelings that belong to our nature
in certain positions. At a late hour one night, I was engaged
in those gloomy watchings and reveries, when Kreutz
came to me, and said the captain had been taken suddenly
ill. I turned my eyes from the scene along the shore I was
surveying, and fixed them for a moment on his face, where
the light of the moon sat in deep contrast with the long
bushy hair that flowed round his temples. A shudder&mdash;that
might have been accounted for from the state of my
mind and the nature of the communication he had made to
me, but which I instinctively attributed, at the time, to the
expression of his face&mdash;passed over me, and, starting up, I
hurried into the cabin off the cuddy, where I found George
under the grasp of relentless spasms of the chest and
stomach. He was stretched along on the floor, grasping the
carpet, which he had wound up into a coil, and vomiting
violently into a bason which he had hurriedly seized before
he fell.</p>

<p>'Good God, Isabella!' he exclaimed, 'what is this? I
am dying. That villain Cr'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And, whether from weakness or prudence, he stopped,
with the guttural sound of these two letters, Cr, which applied
equally to Crawley as to Kreutz, and left me in doubt
which of them he meant. At this moment Buist the mate
entered the cabin; and my agitation and the necessity of
affording relief to the sufferer, took my mind off the fearful
subject hinted at by the broken sentence I had heard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
With the assistance of Buist, I got him placed on the bed.
There was no doctor on board, and I was left to the suggestions
of my own mind, for adopting means to save him.
These were applied, but without imparting any relief. The
painful symptoms continued, and he got every moment
worse. Neither Crawley nor Kreutz appeared; and when
Buist went out to bring what was deemed necessary for the
patient, I hung over him, and asked him what he conceived
to have been the cause of his illness; but my question
startled him&mdash;he looked up wildly in my face; his mind
was directed towards heaven; and the means of salvation
through the redeeming influence of a believed divinity of
Him who died on the cross, was the subject alone on which
he would speak. The scene, at this moment, around me
was extraordinary, and, though I cannot say I had any distinct
perception of the individual circumstances that combined
to make up the sum of my horrors, I can now see, as
through a dark medium, the co-operating elements. There
was no candle in the cabin; the light of the moon through
the windows filling the apartment with a blue glare, and
tinging his pallid face with its hues. My mind, wrought up
by the dreamy visions I had indulged in previously, and
labouring under a disease which imparted to every feeling its
own eliminated gloom, saw even the darkest circumstances
of my condition in a false and unnatural aspect. The scenes
of our youth and early love; the impressions of the religious
sentiments he was muttering in broken snatches; the
view of his approaching death; the dark means by which it
was accomplished; my condition after he should die, in the
power of men I feared; the orgies of the natives I had been
contemplating; the deep grave, so fearful in its dead calmness;
and the monsters that revelled in it, to which he
would be consigned&mdash;all flitted through my brain; but
with such rapidity&mdash;driving out, by short energies, the more
engrossing thoughts concerned in the manner of his recovery&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
I could not particularize them, while I drew, by
some synthetic process of the mind, their general attributes,
and thus increased the terror of the scene.</p>

<p>Two hours passed, and every moment made it more apparent
that my husband was posting to death. There was
no sound heard throughout the ship except the dull tread
of the watch; and, at intervals, the whispers of Crawley,
as he communed stealthily with Buist, who went out of the
cabin repeatedly, to carry intelligence of the state of the
sufferer. For about three quarters of an hour he had been
raving wildly. The detached words he uttered raised, by
their electric power, the working of my fancy which filled
up, by a train of thoughts scarcely more within the province
of reason, the chain of his wandering ideas. No connected
discourse on the subject of his illness, though mixed up
with all the reminiscences of an affection that had lasted
since the period of infancy, or the prospects that awaited
me in the unprecedented position in which I was about to
be thrown, could have distracted me in the manner effected
by these insulated vocables, wrung by madness from expiring
life and reason. They ring in my ears even yet,
when the beams of the moon shine through the casements;
and, even now, I think I see that dimly lighted cabin, and
my husband lying before me in the agonies of death. I
became, as if by some secret sympathy, as much deranged
as himself. As I watched him, I cast rapid looks around
me&mdash;out upon the still deep, in the direction of the fearful
island&mdash;upon the articles of domestic use lying in confusion,
and exhibiting dimly-illuminated sides and dark
shades. It seemed to me some frightful dream; and, when
I turned my eyes again on the pale face which had been
the object of my excited fancy for so many years, saw the
struggles of expiring nature, and heard the wild accents that
still came from his parched lips, I screamed, and tore my
hair in handfuls from my head. In that condition, I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
him die; and the increase of my frenzy, produced by that
consummation of all evils, made me rush out, and forward
to the side of the ship. I felt all the stinging madness of
the resolution to die&mdash;to fly from the man who, I feared,
had murdered him&mdash;to escape from that island of cannibals,
where I thought I would be left by my relentless foes, by
plunging into the deep, when Crawley, who had heard of
his demise, seized me, and dragged me back.</p>

<p>This paroxysm was succeeded by a kind of stupor that
seized my whole mind and body. I sat down on a cot in
the side of the cabin, and saw Kreutz bring in a light.
The glare of it startled me; but it was only as a vision
that could not awake the sleeper. They proceeded to lay
out my husband on a table. They undressed him&mdash;for his
clothes were still on; and I saw them take a large sheet,
wrap it round him, and pin it firmly at all the folds.
When their labours were finished, they took each a large
portion of brandy, and Crawley came forward and offered
me a portion. I had no power to push it from me. He
held it to my mouth; but my lips were motionless; and,
tossing it off himself, he and the others went out of the
cabin. No precaution was taken to keep me within; but
the frenzy that had previously impelled me to self-destruction
had subsided, and I shuddered at what a few moments before
appeared to me to be a source of relief. I sat for
hours in the position in which they left me, gazing upon
the dead body before me, but without the energy to rise
and look at the features of him who had formed the object
of my earliest devotions, the subject of all my fondest
dreams of early youth and matured womanhood, now lying
there lifeless. I had scarcely, during that period, consciousness
of any object, but of a long, white figure extended on
the table, with the moonlight reflected from it. The
stupor left me&mdash;I cannot tell at what hour; and the first
movement of living energy in my brain was a stinging impulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to rush forward and seize the body. I obeyed it,
without a power to resist; and, tearing off the folds, laid
bare the face, which was as placid as I had ever seen it,
when, watching over him, I used to steal a look of him,
during the hours of night, as he slept by my side, in the
moonlight that stole through the cabin-window. In my
agony, I clung to him&mdash;kissed the cold lips&mdash;called out
'George! George!'&mdash;threw the folds of the sheet over the
face&mdash;again looked round me for some one to comfort me&mdash;felt
the consciousness of my perilous position&mdash;and, as a
kind of refuge from the despair that met me on every hand,
withdrew again the folds, and acted over again the frenzied
parts of a madness that mocked the miseries of the inmates
of an asylum.</p>

<p>I must have exhausted myself by the excitement into
which I was thrown; for, some time afterwards, I found
myself lying upon the cot, and wakening again to a consciousness
of all the ills that surrounded me. The light of
the moon had given place to the dull beams of earliest
dawn, which were only sufficient to shew me the extended
figure on the table, and the confusion into which the furniture
of the cabin was thrown. I heard the sounds of several
footsteps in the cuddy. Sounds of voices struck my ear;
and, rising up, I crawled forward to a situation where I could
hear the communings from which my fate might be known.</p>

<p>'When the wind starts,' said Crawley&mdash;'it will be from
the north&mdash;we should turn and make all speed for Rio,
where we may dispose of the cargo, and then run the vessel
to the West Indies. How do the men feel disposed,
Kreutz&mdash;all braced and steady?'</p>

<p>'All but Wingate and Ryder, who are watched by the
others,' replied the German. 'These dogs would mutiny,
ha! ha!&mdash;mein gut friend Buist is against their valking the
plank; but they must either come in or go out. Teufel!
no mutineers aboard the Griffin.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>'Right, Hans,' said Crawley. 'Get Murdoch to knock
together the boards&mdash;we will bury him to-morrow; but the
wife, man, what is to be done with her?'</p>

<p>'Put her ashore, to be sure,' responded Kreutz. 'There
is not von difficulty there. The natives will be glad of
her, and we want her not. If this calm were gone, all
would be gut and recht. That is the von thing only that
troubles me.'</p>

<p>'If there is no wind,' said Crawley, 'to carry us out of
the channel, there is none to bring any one to us.'</p>

<p>At this moment, I thought they heard some movements,
produced by a nervous trembling that came over me, and
forced me to hold by a chair. Some whisperings followed.
Kreutz went away, and Crawley entered. I had just time
to retreat to the other side of the body of my husband. His
manner was now that which was natural to him&mdash;harsh and
repulsive. He ordered me peremptorily to the lower cabin.
I had no power to resist, or even to speak; but I saw, in the
order, the eternal separation of me and George; and, rushing
forward, I withdrew the covering from his face, to take
the last look&mdash;to imprint the last kiss on his cold lips.
The act operated like the stirrings of conscience on the
cowardly man of blood. His averted eye glanced for an
instant on the body, and, seizing the coverlet, he wrapped
up the countenance, and, taking me by the arm, hurried
me down to the apartment set apart for passengers. This
cabin was darker than the captain's, from some of the windows
having been changed into dead lights; and I considered
myself pent up in a dungeon. Hitherto my feelings
had been, in a great measure, the result of existing moving
circumstances; but now I was left to reflection, in so far as
that act of the mind could be concerned in the attempt to
picture the extremities of a fate that seemed as unavoidable
as unparalleled. The diseased visions that had distracted
me before any real evil occurred, were changed, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
their dreamy, shadowy character, to realities. The lengthened
trains of images that were required to satisfy the
cravings of hypochondria, fled; and, in their place, there
was one general, overwhelming fear, that seemed to engross
all my thinking energies, and left no power to particularize
the visions of danger that awaited me among the savages.
There was only one presiding, prevailing idea that served as
the rallying point of my terrors; and that was the dead
body of George, with the white sheet in which he was
swathed, and the peculiarly-formed oaken table on which
he was placed, and at which we used to dine upon all the
dainties to be found on board an Indiaman. It was the
steadfastness of this idea that excluded the images of the
fearful deep recesses&mdash;the Bacchanalian orgies of the savages&mdash;their
anthropophagous rites, their midnight revels; but
retained, as it were, hanging round it, the fear they had engendered,
as a more complex feeling. After Crawley had
left me, I had thrown myself down on a couch&mdash;an act
of which I retained no consciousness; for afterwards, when
daylight began to break in through the only window that
was not closed up, I started to my feet, and did not know,
for some time, that I was separated from the corpse; the
vision of which had, during the interval, been so vivid, that
it combined the conditions of figure and locality as perfectly
as if the object had been before me.</p>

<p>On the deck I now heard the sound of several loud voices,
and afterwards a scuffle, accompanied with the tramping of
feet. There was then silence for a time; but my ears were
stung, on a sudden, by a scream, succeeded by a plash, as
if some one had been precipitated into the sea. A gurgling
noise, as if the individual were drowning, followed; and
the suspicion rushed into my mind, that they had made an
example (to terrify the others) of one of the men who had
rebelled against the authority of the mutineers. A silence,
as deep as that of death, succeeded, which lasted about an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hour, at the end of which period the sound of the saw and
hammer were distinctly heard. I recollected the orders of
Crawley, for Murdoch, the carpenter, to prepare George's
coffin. The knocking continued for a considerable time,
and produced such an effect upon me that the ideas, which
had been, as it were, chained up by the freezing influence
of the prevailing vision of the extended and rolled-up body,
broke away and careered through my mind with the velocity,
unconnectedness, and intensity, that belong to certain
states of excited mania. Images of the past and the future
were mixed up in confusion; and every succeeding thought
stung me with increased pain, till the idea of suicide again
suggested itself, bringing in its train that which destroyed
it&mdash;the terror of an avenging God, who will pass judgment
on the takers of their own lives. I started, and sought
forgiveness; and, for the first time under this agony, felt the
soft action of the balm of a confided trust in Him who has
mercy in endless stores for the good, but who poured his
fury even upon the house of Israel, for the blood they shed
upon the land. But, must I confess it, the relief I felt
from this high source was immediately again lost in the
cold shiverings of instinctive fear, as I heard the knocking
cease, knew the coffin was finished, and perceived, from the
sounds in the cabin off the cuddy, that they were putting
the body into the rudely constructed box, with a view of
burying him in the deep sea.</p>

<p>Some indescribable emotion, at this time, forced me towards
the cabin window, although the sight of the water
was frightful to me. It was still and calm as ever, and the
light was already sufficient to enable me to see far down in
its green recesses. I could not take my eye from it. There
were numerous creatures swimming about in it, some of
which I had got described to me, but many of them I had
never seen before. They seemed more hideous to me now
than they had ever appeared when, on former occasions, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
sat and watched their motions. The large bull-mouthed
shark was there, rolling his huge body in apparent lethargy,
and turning up his white belly in grim playfulness, as if in
mockery of my misery. It had a charm about its truculent
savageness that riveted my attention, while it shook my
frame. It was connected in my mind with the fate of
George's body, which, every moment, I expected to hear
plash in the sea, in the midst of that shoal of creatures
with strange forms and ravenous maws. An exacerbation
of these sickly feelings made me lift my eyes; but it was
only to fix them on the not less fearful island that lay
before in the far distance, and now, in the fogs of the
morning, through which the red sun struggled to send his
beams, appeared a huge mass of inspissated vapour lying
motionless on the surface of the sea. The very indistinctness
of this hazy vision stimulated my fancy to its former
morbid activity, and I saw again the mystic wooded ravines,
sacred to the rights of cannibalism, of which I myself was
doomed to be the object.</p>

<p>From this dream I was roused by the loud tread of men's
feet over my head, as if the individuals were bearing a load
that increased the heaviness of their steps. I was at no
loss for the cause&mdash;they were carrying the coffin with the
body in it to midship, where it was to be let down into its
watery grave. In a short time afterwards, a gurgling of
the waters met my ear, and, struggling to the foot of the
companion ladder, I would have rushed upon deck if my
strength would have permitted; but I fell upon the steps,
and, lying there, heard a cry from some of them. I gathered,
from the detached words I heard, that the bottom of the
coffin had given way, from its insufficiency and the weight
that had been put in it to make it sink; and that the body
had gone down, while the chest swam on the surface.
Several feet were now heard rapidly in motion, and the
voice of Kreutz, who was running aft, fell on my ear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>'Teufel!' I heard him say, 'we shall have that grim corpse
when the gallenblase&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!&mdash;the gall bladder has
burst, rising like von geist from the bottom of the deep sea,
and staring at us. Hell take the stumper, Murdoch!'</p>

<p>These words, uttered by the German, were followed by
some expression from Crawley, no part of which I could
make out, except the oaths directed against the carpenter.
The sounds died away; but I heard enough to satisfy me
of the fact that George's body had been consigned to the
deep with only the shroud to defend it against the attacks
of the ravenous creatures I had been contemplating. My
mind was again forced, and with increased energy, into the
train of gloomy meditations suggested by what I had heard;
and so vivid were the visions that obeyed the excited powers
of my imagination, that I forgot, as I lay brooding over
them on the sofa to which I had staggered, the danger that
next awaited myself. I could not now look at the sea, for
I feared to meet the fact which would add probation to my
imaginations&mdash;that the animals I had seen there had disappeared
to crowd round the prey that had been given to
them. Yet the actual vision of that dear form, mutilated,
torn, and devoured, could not, I am satisfied, have produced
more insufferable agony, than accompanied and resulted
from the diseased imaginings in which my fancy was engaged.
The process that I pictured going on in the bottom
of the sea, was coloured by hues so sickly, and attended by
circumstances so distorted and grim, that all natural appearances,
however harrowing, must have fallen short of the
power they exercised over me. The positions in which I
imagined him to be placed, were varied in a greater degree
than ever I had seen the human body; the expressions of
the countenance, though fixed by death, and not likely to
be changed, became as Protean as the changing postures of
the limbs; and the marine monsters that gambolled or
fought around him for the prize, were invested with forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
colours, and attributes, of a kind not limited to what I had
ever seen in the deep. The only idea that seemed to remain
stationary, and not liable to the mutations into which
all the others were every moment gliding, was the colour
of the body, which was that of the green medium in which
he lay. That sickly hue pervaded all parts; and even the
dark or light colours of the inhabitants of the deep, partook,
more or less, of the prevailing tint. It seemed to be the
universal of all particulars, as time or space is the medium
or condition of existence of all thought and matter; I felt
the impossibility of any idea being true that did not partake
of it; and, so strongly was the feeling of the ex-natural
that accompanied it, that even now I cannot look at anything
green without shuddering.</p>

<p>I cannot tell how long I was under the dominion of this
train of thought. I was, in a manner, torn from it by the
entrance of Kreutz with some food for me. He growled out
a few words of mixed German and English, and left it on
the table. It is needless to say that I could eat nothing.
Even before these misfortunes overtook me, my appetite had
left me; but now I loathed all edibles. After having been
roused from the train of morbid imaginings in which I had
been engaged, and which I clung to as if they imparted to
me some unnatural satisfaction, I felt (and it is a curious
fact) a recoiling disinclination to resume the grim subject,
and even resorted to some imbecile and despairing efforts to
avoid it. It was not that I expected any relief from forbearing:
every other subject that could be suggested by my
position was equally fraught with tears and pains; but that
having, as I now suppose, exhausted, for the time, the diseased
workings, the view of an effort to call up again the
thoughts that had been as it were supplied by disease, penetrated
me with a sensation beyond the powers of endurance.
For two or three hours afterwards, my attention was directed
to the proceedings upon deck; but I could hear little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
beyond indistinct mutterings, and occasional sounds of the
treading of feet over me. The calm, which had lasted for
many days, still continued; and, until a wind sprung up,
no effort could be made by the mutineers to retrace their
progress through the channel, and proceed to their projected
destination. At last the shades of night began to fall; exhausted
nature claimed some relief from her sufferings; but
the drowsiness that overcame me, was only a medium of a
new series of imaginings still more grotesque and unnatural
than those that had haunted me during the day.</p>

<p>When the morning dawned, I expected every moment the
execution of the purpose I had heard declared by Crawley,
to put me ashore on the island; and, during moments of
more rational reflection, I could not account for my not having
been disposed of in this way on the previous day. The
terrors of that destiny were as strong upon me as ever; but,
I must confess, that the view of real evil, almost unprecedented,
as it seemed, in its extent and peculiarity, produced
feelings entirely different from what resulted from the prior
musings of my hypochondriac fancy: I would not be believed
were I to say that the expected reality was not much
more painful than the sickly vision. The miseries were
of different kinds, proceeding from different causes, operating
upon a mind in two different states. There was something
in my own power. I was not justified in committing
suicide as a mode of escape from an affliction that God
might have seen meet to put upon me; but all my reasonings
on this subject fled before the view of this next calamity
that awaited me. An extraordinary thought seized
me, that I was not bound to hold life, when, through my
own body and sensibilities, God's laws were to be overturned,
and my sufferings were to be made a shame in the
face of heaven. I secreted a knife in my bosom, and sat
in silent expectation of the issue. I was again supplied
with meat; but, on this occasion, Crawley brought it to me&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
here began a new evil. He resumed, partially, his
former dastardly sneaking manner; made love to me; offered
me the honour of being still a captain's wife, and accompanied
the offer with, obliquely-hinted threats of a due consequence
of my rejection of his suit. I spurned him; but I cannot
dwell on the details of this proceeding. His suit was
persisted in for two or three days, when, roused to madness,
he told me, that next day, if I consented not, I would be
wedded to the natives of Madagascar. I traced the outline
of the knife through the covering of my bosom, and
defied him.</p>

<p>The next night was clear, and somewhat chill&mdash;indications
of a cessation of the calm. The rudeness of Crawley
had had the effect of keeping my mind from falling into
the grasp of the demon of diseased fantasy; but, now my
fate was fixed, I had no more to fear from him; and towards
midnight, I fell again into the train of imaginings
that had formerly haunted me. I had opened the cabin
window for air&mdash;having felt a suffocating oppression of the
chest during the day, proceeding from the extreme heat and
the confined apartment. My eyes were again fixed in the
direction of the island. I could see the dark shade of the
land lying upon the gilded waters. All was still; my
thoughts sought again the deep&mdash;the grave of George, the
fancied condition of his body; and, as my ideas diverged to
the calm scene around, it appeared to me as if all nature
were dead, and that my own pulsations were the only living
movements on earth. Lights now began to move along
the shore, and then a fire blazed up into the firmament.
The bodies of the savages flitted before it; I had seen the
same appearances before; but I was now connected with
these orgies in a more <i>real</i> manner than formerly. They
ceased, and my mind again sought the recesses of the green
deep, where all I loved on earth lay engulfed. My eye
at times wandered over the surface of the waters; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
feared to look downwards into their bosom. My attention
was suddenly fixed by an object in the sea. I put up my
hands and rubbed my eyes. Was I deceived by a fancy?
No! a dead body was there, not four yards distant from
where I sat. It was that of my husband, rolled up in the
same white sheet in which I had seen him extended on the
oak table, and with his head raised somewhat above the
surface, by the weights placed in the shroud having, as I
afterwards thought, descended to the feet. A part of the
sewing had been torn off the head, which was bare&mdash;the
face was openly exposed to me, the moon shone upon it;
I could perceive the very features, and even the lustreless
eyes, that seemed fixed on the ship. There was not a
breath of wind to ruffle the surface of the sea, which shone
with a blue lustre in the light of the moon; and the body
was as motionless as if it had been fixed on the earth. I
have described, hitherto, what actually befell me, with the
various states of my mind under extraordinary circumstances
of pain and depression. My fancies belonged as
much to nature as the facts which excited and nourished
them, and must be believed by those who have studied the
workings of the mind, even unconnected with the principles
and facts of pathology. This was, however, no vision of
the fancy, but a reality resulting from well-known physical
laws. I sat, fixed immovably, at the window, and felt no
more power of receding from it, than I formerly had of resigning
my musings. My eyes were fixed upon that countenance
which had been the <i>beau ideal</i> of love's idolatry&mdash;the
fairest thing on earth, and the archetype of my dreams
of heaven. I could not fly from it, horrible as it seemed
in its blue glare and ghastly expression. I loved it while it
shocked me; and all my powers of thinking were bound up
in freezing terror. I felt the hair on my head move as the
shrivelling skin became corrugated over my temples. That,
and the occasional throbbings of my heart, were the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
motions of any part of my being; but the body I gazed at
seemed to be as immovable, and its eyes seemed not less
steadfastly fixed on me than mine were on it.</p>

<p>How long I sat in this position I know not. There was
no internal impulse that moved me to desist. I could, I
thought, have looked for ever. Certain fearful objects possess
a charm over the mind&mdash;and this was one of them;
but I have sometimes thought that the power lay in producing
the negative state of mental paralysis; for the instant
my attention was called to a strange noise upon the
deck, I was suddenly recalled to a natural sense of the fear
it inspired. The sounds I heard were a mixture of exclamations
and objections, pronounced in tones of fear and
anger. I turned away my face from the dead body, with a
strong feeling of repugnance to contemplate it again; and,
groping my way to the companion-ladder, listened to what
was going on above. Kreutz and Crawley were in communication.</p>

<p>'There is more than chance in that frightful appearance,'
I heard Crawley say. 'And this calm too&mdash;it will never
end. God have mercy on us! Is there no man that will
undertake to sink the body? I cannot stand the gaze of
these white balls. See! the face is directed towards me; and
yet I did not do the deed, though I authorized it. Will
no one save me from the glare of the grim avenger? I will
give twenty gold pieces to the man who will remove it to
the deep. Go forward, Kreutz, and try if you can prevail
upon a bold heart to undertake the task!'</p>

<p>'Pho, man!' responded the German&mdash;'all von phantasy&mdash;anybody
would have risen in the same way&mdash;Teufel!
I heed it not von peterpfenning. But the men are alarmed,
and begin to say that the captain has not got fair play.
Hush! seize your degen. There is von commotion before
the mast.'</p>

<p>I now heard a tumult in the fore part of the vessel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
began to suspect that the crew had been led to believe that
George had died a natural death, and had been by some
means prevailed upon to work the vessel, when the wind rose
in another direction, under the command of Crawley. The
noise increased, and with it the fears of the cowardly villain
whose conscience had been awakened by such strange means.
Kreutz had left him to try to pacify the men; and the tones
of his terror-struck voice continued to murmur around.</p>

<p>'There it still is,' he groaned, as his attention seemed to
be divided between the sight he contemplated and the tumult,
'gazing steadfastly with these lack-lustre eyes for revenge.
It is on me they are fixed&mdash;immovably fixed&mdash;as a victim
which the spirit that floats over the body in that dead
light of the moon demands, and will get. There is a God
above in that blue firmament, who sees all things. I am
lost. These men obey the call of a power that chooses that
grim apparition as its instrument to call down destruction
on my head. Ha! Kreutz has no influence here; the
avengers are prepared.'</p>

<p>A step now came rapidly forward, and Kreutz's voice was
again heard.</p>

<p>'If you will not try to quell them,' said he, 'all is lost.
They swear the captain has been murdered, and that verdamt
traitor Buist heads them on. Donner! shall Hans
Kreutz die like one muzzled dog? On with degen in hand,
and it may not be too late! We have friends among the
caitiffs; strike down the first man; his blut will terrify
them more than that staring geist, which is, after all, only
von natural body, with no more spirit in it than the bones
of my grandmutter. Frisch! frisch! auf, man! come, come,
dash in and strike the first mutineer!'</p>

<p>The cowardly spirit of Crawley was acted upon by the
stern German; for I heard him cry out&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hold there, men! what means this tumult&mdash;'sdeath?'</p>

<p>The rest of his words were drowned by the noise; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
heard the sounds of his and Kreutz's feet as they rushed
forward. In an instant, the sound like that of a man falling
prostrate on the deck, met my ear; and then there rose
a yell that rung through every cranny of the ship. All
seemed engaged in a desperate struggle. The words 'Revenge
for our captain!' often rose high above all the other
sounds. The clanging of many daggers followed; several
bodies fell with a crash upon the deck, and loud groans, as
if from persons in the agonies of death, were mixed with
the cries of those who were struggling for victory. The
tramping and confusion increased, till all distinct sound
seemed lost in a general uproar. I got alarmed, and left
my station at the foot of the companion-ladder; but I knew
not whither to fly. I took again my seat at the window,
as if I felt that there was an opening for me from which I
might fly from the fearful scene. My agitation had banished
from my mind for an instant the vision of the body;
and I started again with increased fear as my eyes fell upon
the corpse that had apparently been the cause of the uproar.
It was still there, as motionless as before; yet, I thought,
still nearer to me. I saw the features still more distinctly
than ever, and found my mind again chained down by the
charm it threw over me. The sounds for a time seemed to
come upon my ear from a far, far distance, or like those
heard in a dream; and like a dreamer, too, I struggled to
get away from a vision that I at once loved and trembled
at. The noises on deck seemed as those of the world, and
the object before me the creation of the fancy that bound
my soul, but left the sense of hearing open to living sounds.
While in this state, I was suddenly roused by a rush of
several men into the cabin; they held daggers in their hands
and their countenances were besmeared with blood. I
looked at them, under the impression that they were my
enemies, and that the cause of Crawley had triumphed; but
I was soon undeceived&mdash;they told me that both he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Kreutz lay dead upon the deck, and that the victorious
party were determined to complete the voyage and take the
ship to Madras. The removal of one evil from a mind borne
down by the weight of many, only leaves a greater power of
susceptibility of the pain of what remains. The moment I
heard of my own personal safety, I recurred again to the
subject that affected me more deeply than even the fears of
being consigned to the natives of the island&mdash;the dead
body of George was still in the waters. The men understood
and appreciated my sufferings. I again went to the
cabin window, and, pointing to the corpse, implored Buist,
who was present, to get it taken up and buried. He replied,
that that had already been agreed upon, and orders
were given to that effect. Several of the men volunteered of
themselves to assist. A boat was put out, and I watched
the solemn process. I saw them drag up the body from the
sea, and would have flown to the deck to embrace once
more the dearest object of my earthly affections; but I was
restrained from motives of humanity. I had reason to suppose
that it had been dreadfully mutilated, and that was
the reason why I was saved the pain of the sad sight. That
same evening it was consigned again to the deep; and with
it sunk the bodies of his murderers, Crawley and Kreutz.</p>

<p>Next day, a breeze sprang up, and bore us away from
that fatal place. My eyes were fixed on it till I could see
no longer any traces of that island which had caused me so
many fears. In a short time, we arrived in India, where I
remained about two months, and returned again with the
Griffin to Britain.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," she continued, "all these things are in the
course of man's doings in this strange world. It is also
very natural that I should think of him. But a more dreadful
effect has followed. I shudder when I think of it."</p>

<p>She stopped and looked at me, as if she were afraid to
touch upon the subject of the visual illusion. I told her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that I understood the cause of her fears; and having questioned
her, I satisfied myself from her answers that I had
at last discovered a case of true <i>monomania</i>, in which the
patient conceived that she saw, with the same distinctness
as when she looked from the cabin window of the <i>Griffin</i>
the corpse of her husband swimming in the sea, with the
head and chest above the waters, surrounded with the same
blue moonlight, and every minute circumstance attending
the real presence.</p>

<p>I meditated a cure; but I frankly confess that it was my
anxious wish to witness her under the influence of the fit;
and, with that view, I purposed waiting upon her repeatedly
in the evenings, when, under the shaded light of the
candle, it generally came over her. I was baffled in this
for several weeks, chiefly, I presume, from the circumstance
of my presence operating as an engagement of her mind;
but one evening when I was sitting with her mother in
another room, the sister came suddenly, and beckoned me
into that occupied by my patient. The door was opened
quietly and, on looking in, I saw, for the first time, a vision-struck
victim of this extraordinary disease. She sat as if
under a spell, her arms extended, her eyes fixed on the imaginary
object, and every sense bound up in that which contemplated
the spectre vision. The fit ended with a loud
scream; she fell back in her chair, crying wildly&mdash;"George!&mdash;George!"
and lay, for a minute or two, apparently insensible.</p>

<p>I continued my study of this extraordinary case for a
considerable period; and, while I administered to her relief,
I got her to explain to me some things which may be of use
to our profession. I need not say that I was able to penetrate
the dark secret of the seat of either the pathology or
the metaphysique of the disease. That it was connected with
the irritability of her nerves, and the affection of the eyes,
there can be little doubt; because, as she mended in health,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the fits diminished in number, and latterly went off. I may,
however, state that, from all I could learn from her, the fit
was something of the nature of a dream&mdash;all the objects
around her, at the time, being as much unnoticed as if they
existed not; and although she was possessed with an absolute
conviction that the body of her husband was actually
at the time present, it was precisely that kind of conviction
that we feel in a vivid dream.</p>

<h2>THE FOUNDLING AT SEA.</h2>


<p>About the year 1708 or 1710, the good ship <i>Isabella</i>, Captain
Hardy, sailed from the port of Greenock for Bombay,
being chartered by the East India Company to carry out a
quantity of arms and ammunition for the use of the Company's
forces.</p>

<p>The <i>Isabella</i> carried out with her several passengers;
amongst whom were a lady, her child&mdash;a girl about three
years of age&mdash;and a servant-maid. This lady, whose name
was Elderslie, was the wife of a lieutenant in the British
army, who was then with his regiment at Calcutta, whither
she was about to follow him; he having written home that,
as he had been fortunate enough to obtain some semi-civil
appointments in addition to his military services, he would,
in all probability, be a residenter there for many years. The
lieutenant added that, under these circumstances, he wished
his "dear Betsy, and their darling little Julia, to join him
as soon as possible." And this, he said, he had the less
hesitation in requiring, that the appointments he alluded
to would render their situation easy and comfortable.
It was then in obedience to this invitation that Mrs
Elderslie and her child were now passengers on board
the <i>Isabella</i>.</p>

<p>For about six weeks the gallant ship pursued her way
prosperously&mdash;that whole period being marked only by alternatives
of temporary calms and fair winds. The vessel
was now off the coast of Guinea; and here an inscrutable
Providence had decreed that her ill-fated voyage&mdash;for it was
destined to be so, flattering as had been its outset&mdash;should
terminate. A storm arose&mdash;a dreadful storm&mdash;one of those
wild bursts of elemental fury which mock the might of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
man, and hoarsely laugh at his puny and feeble efforts to
resist their destructive powers. For two days and nights the
vessel, stript of every inch of canvass, drove wildly before
the wind; and, on the morning of the third day, struck
furiously on a reef of rocks, at about half a mile's distance
from the shore. On the ship striking, the crew&mdash;not
doubting that she would immediately go to pieces, for a
dreadful sea was beating over her, and she was, besides,
every now and then, surging heavily against the rock on
which she now lay&mdash;instantly took to their boats, accompanied
by the passengers. All the passengers? No, not
all. There was one amissing. It was Mrs Elderslie.
About ten minutes before the ship struck, that unfortunate
lady, together with two men and a boy, were swept from
the deck by a huge sea that broke over the stern; sending,
with irresistible fury, a rushing deluge of water, of many feet
in depth, over the entire length of the ship. Neither Mrs
Elderslie nor any of the unhappy participators in her dismal
fate were seen again.</p>

<p>In the hurry and confusion of taking to the boats, none
recollected that there was still a child on board&mdash;the child
of the unfortunate lady who had just perished; or, if any
did recollect this, none chose to run the risk of missing the
opportunity of escape presented by the boats, by going in
search of the hapless child, who was at that moment below
in the cabin. In the meantime, the overloaded boats&mdash;for
they were much too small to carry the numbers who were
now crowded into them, especially in such a sea as was then
raging&mdash;had pushed off, and were labouring to gain the
shore. It was a destination they were doomed never to
reach. Before they had got half-way, both boats were
swamped&mdash;the one immediately after the other&mdash;and all
on board perished, after a brief struggle with the roaring
and tumbling waves that were bellowing around them.</p>

<p>From this moment, the storm, as if now satisfied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the mischief it had wrought, began to abate. In half an
hour it had altogether subsided; and the waves, though still
rolling heavily, had lost the violence and energy of their
former motion. They seemed worn out and exhausted by
their late fury.</p>

<p>The crew of the unfortunate vessel had left her, as we
have said, in the expectation that she would shortly go to
pieces; but it would have been better for them had they
had more confidence in her strength, and remained by her;
for, strange to tell, she withstood the fury of the elements,
and, though sorely battered and shaken, her dark hull
still rested securely on the rock on which she had struck.
The wreck of the <i>Isabella</i> had been witnessed from the shore
by a crowd of the natives, who had assembled directly opposite
the fatal reef on which she had struck. They would fain
have gone out in their canoes to the unfortunate vessel when
she first struck, as was made evident by some unsuccessful
attempts they made to paddle towards her; but whether
with a friendly or hostile purpose, cannot be known. On
the storm subsiding, however, they renewed their attempts.
A score of canoes started for the wreck, reached it, and, in
an instant after, the deck of the unfortunate vessel was
covered with wild Indians. Whooping and yelling in the
savage excitement occasioned by the novelty of everything
around, they flew madly about the deck, scrambled down
into the hold, tore open bales and packages, and possessed
themselves of whatever most attracted their whimsical and
capricious fancies. While some were thus occupied in the
hold, others were ransacking the cabin. It was here, and at
this moment, that a scene of extraordinary interest took
place. A huge savage, who was peering curiously into one
of the cabin beds, suddenly uttered a yell, so piercing and
unusual, that it attracted the notice of all his wild companions;
then, plunging his hand into the bed, drew forth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and held up to the wondering gaze of the latter, a beautiful
little girl of about three years old. It was the daughter of
the unfortunate Mrs Elderslie. The unconscious child had
slept during the whole of the catastrophe, which had deprived
her, first of her parent, and subsequently of her protectors,
and had only awoke with the shout of the savage
who now held her in his powerful, but not unfriendly
grasp; for he seemed delighted with his prize. He hugged
the infant in his bosom, looked at it, laughed over it, and
performed a thousand antics expressive of his admiration
and affection for the fair and blooming child of which he
had thus strangely become possessed. The child, for some
time, expressed great terror of her new protector and his
sable companions, calling loudly on her mother; but the
anxious and eager endearments of the former gradually
calmed her fears and quieted her cries.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the plunder of the vessel was going on
vigorously in all directions&mdash;above and below, in the cabin
and forecastle, till, at length, as much was collected as the
savages thought their canoes would safely carry. These,
therefore, were now loaded with the booty; and the whole
fleet, shortly after, made for the shore.</p>

<p>In one of these canoes was little Julia Elderslie and her
new protector, who, by still maintaining his friendly charge
over her, shewed that he meant to appropriate her as a part
of his share of the plunder.</p>

<p>On reaching the shore, the kind-hearted savage, as his
whole conduct in the affair shewed him to be, consigned his
little protege to the care of a female&mdash;one of the group of
women who were on the beach awaiting the arrival of the
canoes, and who appeared to be his wife.</p>

<p>The woman received the child with similar expressions of
surprise and delight with those which had marked her husband's
conduct on his first finding her. She turned her
gently round and round, examined her with a delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
curiosity, patted her cheeks, felt her legs and arms, and, in
short, handled her as if she had been some strange toy, or as
if she wished to be assured that she was really a thing of
flesh and blood.</p>

<p>For two days the natives continued their plunder of the
wreck. By the third, the vessel had been cleared of every
article of any value that could be carried away; and on this
being ascertained, a general division of the spoil, accumulated
on the shore, took place.</p>

<p>It was a scene of dreadful confusion and uproar, and
more than once threatened to terminate in bloodshed; but
it eventually closed without any such catastrophe. The
partition was effected, the encampment was broken up, and
the whole band&mdash;men, women, and children, all loaded with
plunder&mdash;commenced their march into the interior; the
little Julia forming part of the burden of the man who had
first appropriated her; a labour in which he was from time
to time relieved by his wife.</p>

<p>From three to four years after the occurrence of the
events just related, a Scotch merchant ship, the <i>Dolphin</i> of
Ayr, Captain Clydesdale, bound for the Cape of Good Hope,
while prosecuting her voyage, unexpectedly run short of
water, in consequence of the bursting of a tank, when off the
Gold Coast of Africa.</p>

<p>On being informed of the accident, the captain determined
on running for the land for the purpose of endeavouring
to procure a further supply of the indispensable
necessary of which he had just sustained so serious a
loss.</p>

<p>The vessel was, accordingly, directed towards the coast,
which she neared in a few hours; and, finally, entered a
small bay, which seemed likely to afford at once the article
wanted, and a safe anchorage for the ship while she waited
for its reception.</p>

<p>By a curious chance, the bay which the <i>Dolphin</i> now entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was the same in which the <i>Isabella</i> had been wrecked
upwards of three years before. But of that ill-fated
vessel there was now no trace; a succession of storms,
similar to that which had first hurled her on the rocks,
had at length accomplished her entire destruction: she had,
in time, been beaten to pieces, and had now wholly disappeared.</p>

<p>There was then no appearance of any kind, no memorial
nor vestige by which those on board the <i>Dolphin</i> might
learn, or at all suspect that the locality they were now in
had been the scene of so deep a tragedy as that recorded in
the early part of our tale.</p>

<p>All unconscious of this, the <i>Dolphin</i> came to within pistol-shot
not only of the reef, but of the identical spot on which
the <i>Isabella</i> had been wrecked.</p>

<p>Having come to anchor, a boat, filled with empty watercasks,
was despatched from the ship for the shore. In this
boat was the captain, first mate, and a pretty numerous
party of men, all well armed, in case of any interruption
from the natives.</p>

<p>On landing, Captain Clydesdale, the mate, and two men,
leaving the others in the boat, set out in quest of water.
The search was not a tedious one. When they had walked
about a quarter of a mile inland, the gratifying noise of a
waterfall struck upon their ears. Following the delightful
sound, they quickly reached a rocky dell into which a crystal
sheet of water, of considerable breadth, was falling from
a height of about fifteen feet; and, after sportively circling
about for a moment in a deep but clear pool below, sought
the channel which conducted to the sea, found it, and glided
noiselessly away.</p>

<p>Delighted with this opportune discovery, Captain Clydesdale
despatched one of the men who was along with him to
the boat, to order the others up with the water casks.</p>

<p>Having seen the people commence the task of filling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
latter, the captain and mate, each armed with a musket,
cutlass, and brace of pistols, started for a walk a little farther
inland, in order to obtain a view of the country. For nearly
an hour they wandered on, now scaling heights, and now
forcing their way through patches of tangled brushwood,
without meeting with any adventure, or seeing anything at
all extraordinary. They had now gained the banks of
the stream which, lower down, formed the cascade at which
the water casks were filling; and this they proposed to
trace downwards, as its banks presented a clear and open
route, till they should reach the point whence they had
started.</p>

<p>While jogging leisurely along this route, the adventurers,
by turning a projecting rock, suddenly opened a small bight
or hollow, sheltered on all sides, except towards the river,
by the high grounds around it. In the centre of this little
glen was an Indian encampment! Alarmed at this unexpected
sight, the captain and mate abruptly halted, and
would have again retreated behind the projecting rock or
knoll which had first concealed them, and taken another
route, but they perceived they were seen by a group of male
natives who were lolling on the grass in front of the wigwams.
On seeing the white men&mdash;who now stood fast,
aware that it was useless to attempt to retreat&mdash;the Indians
sprang to their feet with a loud yell, and rushed towards
them. The captain and mate instinctively brought down
their muskets; for reason would have shown them that resistance
was equally useless with flight. The hostile attitude,
however, which they had assumed, had the effect of
checking the advance of the natives, who suddenly halted,
and, to the great relief of the captain and mate, made
friendly signs of welcome to them.</p>

<p>Confiding in and returning these signs, the latter raised
their muskets and advanced towards the party, who now
also resumed their march towards the strangers. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
met, when, after some attempts at conversation, conducted
on the part of the natives with great good-humour, but, on
both sides, altogether in vain, one of the former suddenly
ran off at full speed towards the wigwams, into one of which
he plunged, and instantly reappeared, leading a female child
of six or seven years of age by the hand. As he advanced
towards the captain and mate, he kept pointing to the child's
face, then to his own, then towards those of the strangers,
and laughing loudly the while.</p>

<p>With an amazement which they would have found it difficult
to express, Clydesdale and his companion perceived that
the child, now produced, was fair, of regular features, smooth
hair, and without any trace of African origin. Exposure to
a tropical sun had deeply embrowned her little cheeks; but
enough of bloom still remained, as, when coupled with other
characteristics, left no doubt on the minds of the captain and
his mate that the child, however it had come into its present
situation, was of European parentage.</p>

<p>His curiosity greatly excited by this extraordinary circumstance,
Mr Clydesdale now endeavoured to obtain some
account of the child from the natives; but he could make
little or nothing of the attempted conference on this subject.
From what, however, he did gather, he came to the conclusion&mdash;a
very accurate one, as the reader may guess&mdash;that
a shipwreck had taken place on the coast, and that the
child had been saved by the natives.</p>

<p>Believing this to be the case, Captain Clydesdale now
became anxious to know whether any others had escaped;
but could not make himself understood. At length one of
the savages, of more apt comprehension than the others,
seemed to have obtained a glimmering of the import of
the captain's queries, and fell upon an ingenious mode of
replying to them. Grasping Mr Clydesdale by the arm,
he conducted him to a small pool of water that was hard
by. He then took a piece of bark that was lying on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ground, placed about a dozen small pebbles on it, and
launched it into the pool. Then stooping down, he edged
it over, till the stones slid, one after the other, into the
water, until one only remained. Allowing the piece of
bark now to right itself, and to float on the water, he
pointed to the single stone it carried, and then to the
child; thus intimating, as Mr Clydesdale understood it,
and as it was evidently meant to signify, that all had
perished excepting the little girl.</p>

<p>While this primitive mode of communication was going
on, the man who had brought the child to Captain Clydesdale
had returned to his wigwam, and now reappeared,
carrying several articles in his hand, which he held up to
the former. Mr Clydesdale took them in his hand, and
found them to consist of fragments of a child's dress, made,
as he thought, after the fashion of those in use in Scotland.
On the corner of what appeared to be the remains of a
little shift, he discovered the initials, J. E. But the most
interesting relic produced on this occasion, was a small
locket, containing some rich black hair on one side, and on
the other the miniature of a young man in a military uniform,
with the same initials, J. E., engraven on the rim.
This locket, the man who brought it gave Captain Clydesdale
to understand, had been found hanging around the
neck of the child when first discovered.</p>

<p>Satisfied now, beyond all doubt, of the child's European
descent, Mr Clydesdale approached her, took her kindly
by the hand, and, hoping to make something of her own
testimony, began to put some questions to her; but, to his
great disappointment, found that she did not understand
him, although he spoke to her both in French and English.
The little girl, in truth, he soon discovered, neither understood
nor spoke any language but that of the tribe in whose
hands she was.</p>

<p>It appeared, however, sufficiently clear to Captain Clydesdale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
that a shipwreck had taken place on the coast, and
that at no very great distance of time, and that the child
before him had been on board of the unfortunate vessel.
Various circumstances, too, led him to the belief that the
ship had been a British one; and in this opinion he was
joined by the mate.</p>

<p>The result of the Captain's reflections on these points,
was a determination to take the child to Scotland with him,
if he could prevail upon her present possessors to part with
her, and to take his chance of making some discovery regarding
her on his return home.</p>

<p>Having come to this resolution, he hastened to make
known to the natives his wish to have the little girl;
and was well pleased to perceive that the proposal, which
they seemed at once to comprehend, was not received
with any surprise, far less indignation. Encouraged by
this reception of his overture, Captain Clydesdale now
addressed himself particularly to the man who appeared
to be the guardian, or, perhaps, proprietor of the child,
and, unbuckling his cutlass from his side, presented it
to him&mdash;making him, at the same time, to understand
that he offered it as the price of the little girl. The man
demurred. Captain Clydesdale pulled a clasp-knife out
of his pocket, and made signs that he would give that
also, provided the locket and fragment of shift, with the
initials on it, were given along with the child. This addition
to the first offer had the desired effect. The cutlass
and knife were accepted, the locket and shift given in exchange,
and the little hand of the girl placed in Captain
Clydesdale's, to signify that she was now his property.
After some farther interchange of civilities with the natives,
the captain, his mate, and the little Julia Elderslie&mdash;for, we
presume, the reader has been all along perfectly aware that
the child in question was no other than that unfortunate
little personage&mdash;proceeded on their way towards the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
where the watering party had been left. This spot they
reached in safety, after about an hour's walking, and found
the men waiting their return&mdash;the casks having been already
all filled and shipped.</p>

<p>In half an hour after, the boat was alongside the <i>Dolphin</i>,
and little Julia was handed upon deck; and, in less
than another hour, the ship was under weigh, and prosecuting
her voyage to the Cape, where she ultimately
arrived in safety. During this time, Captain Clydesdale
had discovered in his Ponakonta&mdash;the name given to little
Julia by the Africans, and by which he delighted to call
her&mdash;a disposition so docile and affectionate, and a manner
so gentle and unobtrusive, that he already loved her with
all the tenderness of a parent, and had secretly resolved
that he would adopt her as his own, and as such bring her
up and educate her, if no one possessed of a better right to
discharge this duty to her should ever appear.</p>

<p>In about six months after the occurrence of the events
just related, the good ship <i>Dolphin</i> arrived safely at the
harbour of Ayr, all well; and the little demi-savage,
Ponakonta, in high spirits, and already beginning to
jabber very passable English&mdash;an acquisition which still
more endeared her to her kind-hearted protector, who
took great delight in listening to her prattle, and in
questioning her regarding her life amongst the Africans&mdash;of
which she was now able to give a tolerably intelligible
account. She had, however, no recollection whatever of
the shipwreck, nor of any incident connected with it.
Some dreamy reminiscences, indeed, she had of her mother;
but, as might have been expected, considering how very
young she was when that catastrophe happened which had
deprived her of her parent, they were too vague and indefinite
to be of the slightest avail towards throwing any light
on her parentage.</p>

<p>On arriving at Ayr, Captain Clydesdale's first step, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
regard to his little charge, was to avail himself of every
means he could think of to make her singular history, with
all its particulars, publicly known, in the hope that it
might bring some one forward who stood in some relationship
to her. The worthy man, however, took this step
merely as one that was right and proper in the case, and
not, by any means, from any desire to get rid of his little
protege. On the contrary, if truth be told, he would have
been sadly disappointed had any one appeared to claim her.
Nothing of this kind occurring, after a lapse of several
weeks, Captain Clydesdale&mdash;who, although pretty far advanced
in years, was unmarried, and had no domestic establishment
of his own, being almost constantly at sea&mdash;placed
little Julia under the charge of some female relatives, with
instructions to give her every sort of education befitting her
years; for all of which&mdash;boarding, clothing, and tuition&mdash;he
came under an obligation to pay quarterly&mdash;giving a
handsome sum, in the meantime, to account. Having
thus disposed of his protege, and satisfied that he had
placed her in good hands, which was indeed the case,
Captain Clydesdale went again to sea&mdash;his destination, on
this occasion, being South America.</p>

<p>The worthy man, however, did not go away before having
a parting interview with his little Ponakonta, whom
he kissed a thousand times, nor before he had entreated
for her every kindness and attention, during his absence,
at the hands of those whom he had now constituted her
guardians. It was upwards of two years before Captain
Clydesdale returned from this voyage; for it included
several trading trips between foreign ports; and thus was
his absence prolonged.</p>

<p>Great was the good man's delight with the improvement
which he found had taken place on his little charge
since his departure. She now spoke English fluently; had
made rapid progress in her education; and gave promise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
being more than ordinarily beautiful. Captain Clydesdale
had the farther satisfaction of learning that she was a universal
favourite&mdash;her gentle manners and affectionate disposition
having endeared her to all.</p>

<p>On first casting eyes on her protector, after his return
from South America, little Julia at once recognised him,
flew towards him, flung her arms about his neck, and wept
for joy&mdash;calling him, in muttered sounds, her father, her
dear father. Deeply affected by the warmth of the grateful
child's regard, Captain Clydesdale, with streaming eyes,
took her up in his arms, hugged her to his bosom, and
kissed her with all the fervour of parental love. Soon
after, Captain Clydesdale again went to sea; and, by and
by, again returned. Voyage after voyage followed, of
various lengths; and, after the termination of each, the
worthy man found his interesting protege still advancing
in the way of improvement, and still strengthening her hold
on the affections of those around her.</p>

<p>Time thus passed on, until a period of nine years had
slipped away; and when it had, Julia Elderslie&mdash;who now
bore, and had all along, since her arrival in Scotland, borne,
the name of Maria Clydesdale&mdash;was a blooming and highly
accomplished girl of sixteen.</p>

<p>It was about this period that Captain Clydesdale began
to think of retiring from the sea, and of settling at home
for the remainder of his life. He was now upwards of sixty
years of age, and found himself fast getting incompetent to
the arduous duties of his profession. Fortunately, he was
in a condition, as regarded circumstances, to enable him
to effect the retirement he meditated. He was by no means
rich; but, having never married, he had accumulated sufficient
to live upon, for the few remaining years that might
be vouchsafed him.</p>

<p>Part of Captain Clydesdale's little plan, on this occasion,
was to rent or purchase a small house in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of the village of Fernlee, his native place, in the west of
Scotland; to furnish it, and to take his adopted daughter
to live with him as his housekeeper. All this was accordingly
done; a house, a very pretty little cottage, with garden
behind, and flower-plot in front, was taken, furnished,
and occupied by Mr Clydesdale and his protege. Here,
for two years, they enjoyed all the happiness of which their
position and circumstances were capable&mdash;and it was a
happiness of a very enviable kind. No daughter, however
deep her love, could have conducted herself towards her
parent with more tenderness, or with more anxious solicitude
for his ease and comfort, than did Maria Clydesdale
towards her protector. Nor could any parent more sensibly
feel, or more gratefully mark the affectionate attentions of
a child, than did Captain Clydesdale those of his Maria.</p>

<p>He doated on her, and to such a degree, that he never
felt happy when she was out of his sight.</p>

<p>More than satisfied with her lot, Maria sought no other
scenes of enjoyment than those of her humble home; and
coveted no other happiness than what she found in contributing
to that of her benefactor.</p>

<p>Thus happily, then, flew two delightful years over the old
man and his adopted child; and, wrapped up in their felicity,
they dreamt not of reverses. But reverses came;
Misfortune found her way even into their lonely retirement.
Within one week, Captain Clydesdale received intelligence
of the total loss of two vessels of which he was the principal
owner, and in which nearly all that he was worth was
invested. The blow was a severe and unexpected one, and
affected the old man deeply. Not on his own account, as he
told his Maria, with a tear standing in his eye, but on hers.
"I had hoped," he said, "to leave you in independence&mdash;an
humble one indeed, but more than sufficient to place
you far beyond the reach of want. But now&mdash;&mdash;" And
the old man wrung his hands in exquisite agony of grief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Infinitely more distressed by the sight of her benefactor's
unhappiness than by the misfortune which occasioned it,
Maria flung her arms about his neck, and said everything
she could think of to assuage his grief and to reconcile him
to what had happened. Amongst other things, she told
him that the accomplishments which his generosity had
put her in possession were more than sufficient to secure her
an independence, or, at least, the means of living comfortably;
and that she would immediately make them available
for their common support.</p>

<p>"There are a number of wealthy families around us, my
dear father," she said, "from which I have no doubt of
obtaining ample employment. I can teach music, drawing,
French, sewing, &amp;c.; and will instantly make application to
the various quarters where I am likely to succeed in turning
them to account. Besides, father," she continued, "it
is probable that we shall soon have some great family in
Park House; and, in such case, I might calculate on obtaining
some employment there&mdash;perhaps enough of itself
to occupy all my time."</p>

<p>To all this the old man made no reply&mdash;he could make
none. He merely took the amiable girl in his arms, embraced
her, and bade God bless her.</p>

<p>Although the mention by Miss Clydesdale of the particular
residence above named appears a merely incidental circumstance,
and one, seemingly, of no great importance, it is
yet one, as the sequel will shew, so connected with our
story, that a particular or two regarding it may not be
deemed superfluous.</p>

<p>Park House was a large, a magnificent mansion, with a
splendid estate attached, both of which were, at this moment,
in the market. The house was within a quarter of a
mile of Captain Clydesdale's cottage, and the reference in
the advertisements to those who wished to see the house
and grounds, was made to the captain, who, with his usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
readiness to oblige, had undertaken this duty&mdash;a duty which
he had already discharged towards several visitors&mdash;none of
whom, however, had become purchasers. It was about a
week after the period last referred to&mdash;namely, that marked
by the circumstance of Mr Clydesdale's losses&mdash;that a gentleman's
carriage drove up to the little gate which conducted
to that worthy man's residence. From this carriage descended
a tall military-looking man, of apparently about
sixty years of age, who immediately advanced towards the
house. Captain Clydesdale, who saw him approaching,
hastened out to meet him. The latter, on seeing the captain,
bowed politely, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Clydesdale, I presume, sir?"</p>

<p>"The same, at your service, sir," replied the honest
seaman.</p>

<p>"You are referred, to, sir, I think, as the person to whom
those wishing to see Park House and grounds should
apply."</p>

<p>"I am," replied Mr Clydesdale; "and will be happy to
shew them to you, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the visitor. "It is precisely for that
purpose I have taken the liberty of calling on you. I have
some idea of purchasing the estate, if I find it to answer my
expectations."</p>

<p>"Will you have the goodness to step into the house, sir,
for a few moments, and I will then be at your service?" said
Captain Clydesdale.</p>

<p>The gentleman bowed acquiescence, and, conducted by
the former, walked into the house, and was ushered into a
little front parlour, in which Miss Clydesdale was at the
moment engaged in sewing. On the entrance of the visitor,
she rose, in some confusion, and was about to retire,
when the latter, entreating that he might not be the cause
of driving her away, she resumed her seat and her work.
Having also seated himself, the stranger now made some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
remarks of an ordinary character, by way of filling up the
interval occasioned by the absence of Captain Clydesdale.
Many words, however, had he not spoken, nor long had he
looked on the fair countenance of his companion, when he
seemed struck by something in her appearance which appeared
at once to interest and perplex him. From the moment
that this feeling took possession of the stranger, he
spoke no more, but continued gazing earnestly at the downcast
countenance of Maria Clydesdale; who, conscious of,
and abashed by the gaze, kept her face close over the work
in which she was engaged. From this awkward situation,
however, she was quickly relieved by the entrance of Captain
Clydesdale, who came to say that he was now ready to
accompany his visitor to Park House. The latter rose,
wished Miss Clydesdale a good morning; accompanying
the expressions, however, with another of those looks of interest
and perplexity with which he had been from time
to time contemplating her for the last five or ten minutes,
and followed the captain out of the apartment.</p>

<p>"That interesting and very beautiful young lady whom I
saw at your house is your daughter, sir, I presume?" said
the stranger to Captain Clydesdale, as they proceeded together
towards Park House.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, she is: that is, I may <i>say</i> she is; for I have
brought her up since she was a child; and she has never,
at least, not since she was five or six years of age, had any
other protector than myself. She never knew her parents."</p>

<p>"Ah! a foundling," said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, but under rather extraordinary circumstances. I
found her amongst the savages of the coast of Guinea."</p>

<p>"On the coast of Guinea!" exclaimed the stranger, in
much amazement. "Very extraordinary, indeed. What
are the circumstances, if I may inquire?"</p>

<p>Captain Clydesdale related them as they are already before
the reader; not omitting to mention the fragment of shift,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
with the initials on it, and the locket with hair and miniature,
which he still carefully kept.</p>

<p>On Captain Clydesdale concluding, the stranger suddenly
stopped short, and, looking at the former with a countenance
pale with emotion, said&mdash;"Good God, sir, what is this?
I am bewildered, confounded. I know not what to think.
It is possible. Yet it cannot be. My name, sir, is Elderslie,
General Elderslie. I have just returned from the East
Indies, where I have been for the last seventeen years.
Shortly after my going out, my wife and child, a daughter,
embarked on board the <i>Isabella</i> from Greenock, to join me
at Calcutta. The ship never reached her destination; she
was never more heard of; but there was a report that she
was seen, if not bespoken, off the Gold Coast; and from
there being no trace of her afterwards, it is more than probable
that she was wrecked on these shores; and, O God!
it is probable also, although I dare not allow myself to
believe it, that this girl is&mdash;is my child! Let us return, let
us return instantly," he added, with increasing agitation,
and now grasping Captain Clydesdale by the arm, "that I
may see this locket you speak of. I gave such a trinket to
my beloved, my unfortunate wife. The initials you mention
correspond exactly. My child's name was Julia Elderslie;
my own Christian name is James; and the same
initials are thus also on the rim of the locket."</p>

<p>"It is precisely so!" said Captain Clydesdale, with a
degree of surprise and emotion not less intense than those
of the general's. "There <i>are</i> the initials of J. E. also on
the locket; and now that my <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'atttention'">attention</ins> is called to the
circumstance, there is a strong resemblance between the
miniature it encloses, and the person now before me."</p>

<p>"Let us hasten to the house, for God's sake! captain,"
said the general, with breathless eagerness, "and have this
matter cleared up, if possible."</p>

<p>They returned to the house. Captain Clydesdale put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
locket and the fragment of the little shift, which bore the
initials J. E., into the hands of the general. He glanced
at the latter, examined the former for an instant with
trembling hands, staggered backwards a pace or two, and
sank into a chair. It was the identical locket which, some
twenty years before, he had given to his wife. The miniature
it contained, introduced into the trinket at a subsequent
period, was his own likeness.</p>

<p>"Bring me my child, Captain Clydesdale," said the
general, on recovering his composure; "for I can no longer
doubt that your adopted daughter is, indeed, my Julia."</p>

<p>Captain Clydesdale left the apartment, and in a moment
returned leading in Julia Elderslie, who had hitherto been
kept in ignorance of what was passing. On her entrance
the general rushed towards her, took her by the left hand,
gently pushed the sleeve of her gown a little way up the
wrist, saw that the latter exhibited a small brown mole,
and exclaiming&mdash;"The proof is complete; you are&mdash;you are
my daughter, the image of your darling but ill-fated mother,"
took her in his arms in a transport of joy.</p>

<p>The feelings of Julia Elderslie, on this extraordinary
occasion, we need not describe, they will readily be conceived.
Neither need we detain the reader with any further
detail; seeing that, with the incident just mentioned, the
interest of our story terminates.</p>

<p>It will be enough now, then, to say, that General Elderslie,
who had amassed a princely fortune, bought the estate
and mansion of Park House. That he took every opportunity,
and adopted every means he could think of, of shewing
his gratitude to Captain Clydesdale, for the generous
part he had acted towards his daughter. That this daughter
ultimately inherited his entire fortune; the general
having never married a second time; and that she finally
married into a family of high rank and extensive influence
in the west of Scotland.</p>

<h2>THE ASSASSIN.</h2>


<p>At a late hour of an evening in the beginning of the year
1569, mine host of the Stag and Hounds&mdash;the principal
hostelry of Linlithgow at the period referred to&mdash;was suddenly
called from his liquor&mdash;the which liquor he was at
the moment enjoying with a few select friends who were
assembled in the public room of the house&mdash;to receive a
traveller who had just ridden up to the door.</p>

<p>Much as Andrew Nimmo&mdash;for such was the name of
mine host&mdash;much, we say, as Andrew loved custom, it was
not without reluctance that he rose to leave his party to
attend the duties of his calling on the present occasion.
He would rather he had not been disturbed; for he was
in the middle of an exceedingly interesting story, when the
summons reached him, and was very unwilling to leave it
unfinished. But business must be attended to; its demands
are imperative; and no man, after all, could be more
sensible of this than mine host of the Stag and Hounds.
So, however reluctant, from his seat he rose, and, telling
his friends he would rejoin them presently, hastened out of
the apartment.</p>

<p>On reaching the door, Andrew found the traveller had
dismounted. He was standing by the head of his horse&mdash;a
powerful black charger&mdash;and seemingly waiting for some
one to relieve him of the animal.</p>

<p>This duty Andrew now performed; he took hold of the
bridle, after a word or two of welcome to his guest, and
asked whether he should put up the horse and supper him?</p>

<p>"What else have I come here for?" replied the stranger,
gruffly. "Surely put him up; but I must see myself to
his being properly suppered and tended. If we expect a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
horse to do his duty, we must do our duty by him. So
lead the way, friend!"</p>

<p>Damped by the uncourteous manner of the traveller,
Andrew made no further reply than a muttered acquiescence
in the justice of the remark just made, but instantly led
the horse away towards the stable; calling out, as he went,
on John Ramsay, the ostler, to come out with the buet&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
lantern; for it was pitch dark, and a light, of course,
indispensable.</p>

<p>With the scrutinizing habits of his calling, mine host of
the Stag and Hounds had been secretly but anxiously endeavouring
to make out his customer; to arrive at some
idea of his rank and profession, if he had any; but the
darkness of the night had prevented him from noting more
than that he was a man of tall stature, and, he thought, of
a singularly stern aspect.</p>

<p>When Ramsay had brought the light, however, mine
host obtained farther and better opportunities of pursuing
his study of the stranger; and, besides having his former
remarks confirmed, now discovered that he had the appearance
of a person of some consideration, his dress being that
of a gentleman.</p>

<p>"Fine beast that, sir!" adventured mine host, after a
silence of some time, during which the latter and his guest
had been standing together overlooking the operation of
John Ramsay as he fed and littered the animal, whose
noble proportions had elicited the remark. "Poorfu' beast,
sir," continued Mr Nimmo. "I think I hae never seen a
better."</p>

<p>"Not often, friend, I daresay," replied the stranger, who
was standing erect, with folded arms, and carefully marking
every proceeding of the ostler. "For a long run and a
swift, he is the animal for a man to trust his life to."</p>

<p>Mine host was startled a little by the turn given to this
remark: it smelt somewhat, he thought, of the highway; or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
at any rate, seemed to carry with it a somewhat suspicious
sort of reference. He was, however, much too prudent a
man to exhibit any indication of an opinion so injurious
to the character of his guest, and, therefore, merely said
laughingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"That he weel believed that if a man war in sic jeopardy
as required his trusting to horse legs for his life, he wad
be safe aneuch on sic a beast as that, especially if he got
onything o' a reasonable start."</p>

<p>"Yes, give him ten minutes of a start, and there's not a
witch that ever rode over North Berwick Law on a broomstick
that'll throw salt on his tail, let alone a horse and
rider of flesh and blood!" replied the stranger, with a grim
smile. "<i>I'll</i> trust my life to him," he added, emphatically,
"and have no fears for the result."</p>

<p>The tendence on the much prized animal which was the
subject of these remarks having now been completed, mine
host and his guest left the stable, and proceeded to the house,
which having entered, the former ushered the latter into the
public room, being the best in the house, and the only one
fit for the reception, as our worthy landlord deemed it, of a
personage of the stranger's apparent quality.</p>

<p>The latter at first shewed some reluctance to enter an
apartment in which there was already so many people assembled;
for it was still occupied by the company formerly
alluded to; but, on being told by mine host that he should
have a table to himself, in a distant part of the room, if he
did not wish for society, he expressed himself reconciled to
the arrangement, and, walking into the apartment, took his
place at its upper end; then throwing himself down in a
chair, having previously laid aside his hat, cloak, and sword,
he commenced a vigilant but silent scrutiny of the party by
which the table that occupied the centre of the apartment
was surrounded. While he was thus employed, the landlord,
who had gone for a moment about some household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
business, approached him to receive his orders regarding his
night's entertainment. The result of the conference on this
subject, was an order for supper, and for a measure of wine
to be brought in, in the meantime, until the former should
be prepared. The landlord bowed, and retired to execute
his commissions. In a minute after, a pewter measure of
claret, with a tall drinking glass, stood before the stranger.
He filled up the latter from the former, drank it off, and
again set himself to the task of scrutinizing the company
before him&mdash;a task to which he now added that of listening
to their conversation, which seemed to be of a nature to
interest him much, if one might judge from the earnest
intensity of his look, and the varying but strongly marked
expression of countenance with which he listened to the
various sentiments of the various speakers. The subject of
the conversation was the Regent Murray&mdash;his proceedings,
government, and character.</p>

<p>"Aweel, folk may say what they like o' the Regent," said
one of the speakers, "but I think he's managing matters
very weel on the whole, and I wish we may never hae a
waur in his place. He's no a man to be trifled wi'; and if
he keeps a tight rein hand, he doesna o'erride the strength
o' his steed. He's a strict, justice-loving man; that I'll
say o' him."</p>

<p>"Then ye say mair o' him than I wad, deacon," said another
of the party. "His strictness I grant ye; but as to
his justice, there was unco little o't, I think, in his treatment
o' his sister: his conduct to that poor woman has been
most unnatural, most savage, selfish, and unfeelin. That's
my opinion o't, and it's the opinion o' mony a ane besides
me."</p>

<p>"Weel, weel; every are has his ain mind o' thae things,
Mr Clinkscales," replied the first speaker; "but for my part,
I'll ay ride the ford as I find it; that's my creed."</p>

<p>"Has ony o' ye heard," here interposed another of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
party, "o' that cruel case o' Hamilton's o' Bothwellhaugh?
Ane o' the Queen's Hamilton's," added the querist.</p>

<p>Some said they had, others that they had not. For the
benefit of the latter, the speaker explained. He said that
Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh was one of those who had been
forfeited for the part he took at the battle of Langside.
That the person to whom his property was given by the
Regent, had turned Hamilton's wife out of her home, unclothed,
and in a wild and stormy night; and that the poor
woman had died in consequence of this cruel treatment.</p>

<p>"An' what's Hamilton sayin to that?" inquired one of
the party.</p>

<p>"They say he's in an awfu takin about it," replied the
first speaker, "an' threatenin vengeance, richt an' left; particularly
against the Regent."</p>

<p>"I think little wonder o't," said another of the party.
"It's a shamefu business, and aneuch to mak ony man desperate."</p>

<p>"But is't true?" here inquired another.</p>

<p>The reply to this question came from a very unexpected
quarter: it came from the stranger, who, starting fiercely
to his feet, and stretching towards the company with a look
and gesture of great excitement, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, gentlemen, true it is&mdash;true as God is in heaven&mdash;true
in every particular. An eternal monument to the
justice and clemency of the tyrant Murray. The wife of
Bothwellhaugh was turned naked out of her own house in
a cold and bitter night, and died of bodily suffering and a
broken heart. She did&mdash;she did. But"&mdash;and the stranger
ground his teeth and clenched his fist as he pronounced
the word&mdash;"there will be a day of count and reckoning.
The vengeance, the deadly vengeance of a ruined, deeply
injured, and desperate man, will yet overtake the ruthless,
remorseless tyrant."</p>

<p>Having thus delivered himself, the stranger again retired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to his former place, reseated himself, and relapsed into his
former silence; although the deep and laboured respiration
of recent excitement, which he could not subdue, might
still be distinctly heard even from the farthest end of the
apartment.</p>

<p>It was some time after the stranger had retired to his
place before the company felt disposed to resume their conversation.
The incident which had just occurred, the
energy with which the stranger had spoken, and the extreme
excitement he had evinced, had had the effect of
throwing them all into that silent and reflective mood
which the sudden display of anything surprising or interesting
is so apt to produce even in our merriest and most
thoughtless moments.</p>

<p>At length, however, the chill gradually wore off; the
conversation was resumed, at first in an under tone, and
by fits and starts; by and by it became more continuous;
and, finally, began to flow with all its original volume and
freedom. No more allusion, however, was made by any
of the party to the case of Bothwellhaugh. This was a
subject to which, after what had taken place, none seemed
to care about returning. Neither did the stranger evince
any desire to hold farther correspondence with the revellers;
but, on the contrary, appeared anxious to avoid it; nay,
one might almost have supposed that he regretted having
obtruded himself upon them at all, and that he could
have wished that what he had uttered in an unguarded
moment had remained unsaid. Be this as it may, however,
he sought no farther intercourse with the party, but
having hastily despatched the supper which was placed
before him, and finished his measure of wine, he glided
unobserved out of the apartment, and, conducted by his
host, retired to the sleeping chamber which had been appointed
for him.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the stranger, who was sojourning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
at the Stag and Hounds, went out to transact, as he
told his landlord, some business in the town; saying, besides,
that he would not probably return till evening.</p>

<p>Strongly impressed by the manner and appearance of
his guest, and not a little awed by his grim and fierce
aspect, he of the Stag and Hounds could not help following
him to the door, when he departed, and furtively
looking after him as he stalked down the main street of
the town; and much, as he looked at him, did he marvel
what sort of business it could be he was going about.
This, however, was a point on which the worthy man had
no means of enlightening himself, and he was therefore
obliged to be content with the privilege of muttering some
expressions of the wonder he felt.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the stranger had turned an angle of the
street, and disappeared&mdash;at least from the view of the landlord
of the Stag and Hounds. Not from ours; for we shall
follow and keep sight of him, and endeavour to make out
what he was so curious to know.</p>

<p>Having passed about half-way down the main street of
the town, the former suddenly halted before a large unoccupied
house, with a balcony in front. It was a residence
of the Archbishop of St Andrew's. Standing in
front of this house, the stranger seemed to scan it with
earnest scrutiny. He looked from window to window with
the most cautious and deliberate vigilance, and appeared to
be noting carefully their various heights and positions.
While pursuing this inquiry, he might also have been frequently
observed glancing, from time to time, on either
side, as if to see that no one was marking the earnestness
of his examination of the building.</p>

<p>Having apparently completed his survey of the front of
the house, the stranger passed round to the back part of the
building, and proceeded to the gate of the garden, which lay
behind, and through which only was the house accessible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
on that side. On reaching the gate, the stranger paused,
looked cautiously around him for a few seconds, when,
observing no one in sight, he hastily plunged his hand
beneath his cloak, drew out a key, applied it to the lock,
opened the gate, passed quickly in, and closed the door
cautiously behind him.</p>

<p>With hurried step the intruder now proceeded to the
house, drew forth another key, inserted it into the lock of
the main door, turned it round, applied his foot to the
latter, pushed it open, and entered the building; having
previously, as in the former instance, secured the door behind
him. Ascending the stair in the inside of the house,
the mysterious visitant now commenced a careful examination
of the various apartments on the second floor; and at
length adopting one&mdash;a small room, with one window to
the front&mdash;made it the scene of his future operations.
These were, the laying on the floor a straw mattress, which
he dragged from another apartment, and hanging a piece
of black cloth&mdash;which he also found in the lumber-room,
from whence he had taken the mattress&mdash;against the wall
of the apartment opposite the window.</p>

<p>Having completed these preparations, the secret workman
went up to the window, knelt down on the mattress,
and levelling a stick, or staff, which he found in the apartment,
as if it had been a musket, seemed to be trying where
he might be best situated for firing at an object without.
This experiment he tried repeatedly; shifting his position
from place to place, until he appeared to have hit upon one
that promised to suit his purpose.</p>

<p>This ascertained, he rose from his knees; threw down
the staff; glanced around the apartment, as if to see that
all was right; descended the stair; came out of the house,
locking the door after him; crossed the garden, and passed
out at the gate, locking that also before he left, and with the
same precaution that he had used at entering; that is, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
around him to see that no one marked his proceedings.</p>

<p>The guest of the Stag and Hounds now returned to his
inn, from which he had been absent about two hours. At
the door he was met by mine host, who, touching his cap,
asked if "his honour intended dining at his house, as it
was now about one of the clock," the general dinner-hour
of the period.</p>

<p>Without noticing the inquiry of his landlord&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be there any armourers in this town of yours, friend?"
he said, "where I could fit me with some weapons I want."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, there be one, and a main good one he is,"
replied the other. "Tom Wilson, I warrant me, will fit
your honour with any weapon you can desire, from a pistolet
to a culverin; from a two-handed sword of six feet
long, to a dagger like a bodkin. And as for armour, you may
have anything, everything from head-piece to leg-splent; all
of the best material, and first-rate workmanship."</p>

<p>"Where is this man Wilson's shop?" inquired the stranger.</p>

<p>"See you, sir," replied the other; "see you yonder projecting
corner, beyond the palace entrance?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, three doors beyond that, you will find Wilson's
shop; and, if your honour chooses, you may use my
name with him, and he will not serve you the worse, or
the less reasonably, I warrant me. It is always a recommendation
to Tom to be a guest at the Stag and
Hounds."</p>

<p>Without saying whether or not he would avail himself of
the privilege offered him of using his name, the mysterious
stranger hastened away in the direction pointed out to him,
and, in half a minute after, he was in the workshop of
Wilson the armourer.</p>

<p>"Your pleasure, sir," said that person, advancing towards
his customer from an inner apartment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you a good store of fire-arms, friend?" inquired
the latter.</p>

<p>"Pretty fair, sir; pretty fair," replied the armourer
"What description may you want?"</p>

<p>"Why, I want a carbine, friend&mdash;something of a sure
piece&mdash;that will carry its ball well to the mark. None of
your bungling articles, that first hang fire, and then throw
their shot in every direction but the right one. I would
have a piece of good and certain execution."</p>

<p>"Here, then, sir, here is your commodity," said the
armourer, disengaging a short and heavy gun from an arms'-rack
that occupied one side of the shop. "Here is a piece
that I can recommend. It will be the fault of the hand or
the eye when this barker misses its mark, I warrant ye.
I'd take in hand myself to smash an egg with it, with single
ball, at fifty yards distance. I have done it before now
with a worse gun."</p>

<p>"I will not require any such feat from the piece as that,
friend," said Wilson's customer, drily; and having taken
the gun in his hand, he began to examine the lock, and to
see that the piece was otherwise in serviceable condition.
Being satisfied that it was, he demanded the price. It was
named. The money was tendered, and accepted, and the
stranger departed with his purchase; having, however, previously
received from the armourer, in lieu of luck's-penny,
although he offered to pay for them, half a dozen balls, and
a few charges of powder, to put the capability of the gun to
immediate trial. This, however, its new proprietor did not
think necessary; but, instead, returned to the archbishop's
house with it; and, after loading and priming it, placed it
in a corner of the apartment, which we have described him
as having put into so strange a state of preparation.</p>

<p>Leaving the house with the same cautious and stealthy
step as before, the stranger again returned to his inn; but
it was now to leave it no more for the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"What news stirring, friend?" said he to the landlord.</p>

<p>"Naething, sir," replied he, as he laid the cloth for his
dinner; "only that the Regent will pass through the town
to-morrow. I hear he'll be this way about twelve o'clock.
The magistrates, I understand, hae gotten notice to that
effect."</p>

<p>"So," replied the stranger. "Then we shall have a sight."</p>

<p>"A brave sight, sir, for he is to be accompanied by a
gallant cavalcade, and the trades of the town are to turn
out with banners and music to do him honour. It will be
a stirring day, sir, and I trust a good one for my poor house
here; for such doings make people as thirsty as so many
dry sponges."</p>

<p>To these remarks the guest made no reply, but proceeded
with his dinner; the materials for which having, in the
meantime, been brought in, and placed on the table by another
attendant.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the little town of Linlithgow
exhibited a scene of unusual bustle. Hosts of idlers were
seen gathered here and there, along the whole line of the
main street; and persons carrying trades' banners&mdash;as yet,
however, carefully rolled up&mdash;might be seen hurrying in all
directions to the various mustering-places of their crafts.
An occasional discharge of a culverin too; and, as the morning
advanced, a merry peal of bells heightened the promise
of some impending event of unusual occurrence. By and by,
these symptoms of public rejoicing became more and more
marked: the groups of idlers increased; the banners were
unfurled; the firing of the culverins became more frequent;
and the bells either really did ring, or appeared to ring
more furiously.</p>

<p>It was when matters thus bespoke the near approach of
a crisis&mdash;which crisis, we may as well say at once, was the
advent of the Regent&mdash;that the mysterious lodger at the
Stag and Hounds ordered his horse to be brought to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
door. The horse was brought; the stranger settled his
bill; and, saying to his landlord that he would witness the
sight from horseback more advantageously than on foot,
mounted, and rode off in the direction of the approaching
cavalcade. In this direction, however, he did not ride far;
for, on gaining the eastern extremity of the town, he suddenly
wheeled round, and rode back in rear of the line of
street, until he reached the gate of the garden behind the
mansion of the Archbishop of St Andrew's, in which the
mysterious preparation before described had been made.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the gate, he dismounted, opened it,
led in his horse, and fastened him to a tree close by. This
done, he removed the lintel, or cross-bar, over the gate.
The latter, contrary to his practice on former occasions,
he now left wide open, and proceeded towards the house,
into which he disappeared.</p>

<p>In less than a quarter of an hour after, the Regent had
entered the town. He was on horseback, surrounded by a
number of friends, also mounted, and followed by a numerous
party of armed retainers.</p>

<p>As the cavalcade penetrated into the town, the crowd,
which the occasion had assembled, gradually became more
and more dense, and the progress of the Regent and his
party consequently more slow; until, at length, they were
so packed in the narrow street, with the human wedges
that were forcing themselves around them, that it was with
great difficulty they could make any forward progress at all.</p>

<p>Becoming impatient with the delay thus occasioned,
although carefully concealing this impatience, the Regent,
who was now directly opposite the house of the Archbishop
of St Andrew's, kept waving his hand to the crowd, as if
entreating them not to press so closely, that he might pass
on with more speed. The crowd endeavoured to comply
with the wishes of the Regent, but their efforts only added
to the confusion, without mending the matter in other respects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
It was at this moment that all eyes were suddenly
directed towards the house of the Archbishop of St Andrew's,
in consequence of a shot being fired from one of the
windows. When these eyes looked an instant after again
towards the Regent, he was not to be seen; he had fallen
from his horse, mortally wounded: a ball had passed through
his body. It was Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh who had
fired the fatal shot.</p>

<p>The friends and retainers of the Regent, seconded by the
town's people, flew to the house of the archbishop, and
endeavoured to force the door, in order to get at the murderer
but it had been barricaded by the wily assassin, and
resisted their efforts long enough to allow of his escaping
from the house, mounting his horse, and darting through
the garden gate at the top of his utmost speed. He was
pursued; but, thanks to his good steed, pursued in vain,
and subsequently escaped to France; having done a deed
which the moralist must condemn, but which cannot be
looked upon as altogether without palliation.</p>

<h2>THE PRISONER OF WAR.</h2>


<p>I had been preserved, through divine mercy, from one of
the most lingering and fearful deaths. I was rescued, I
scarce knew how, after the grim king of terror held me in
his embrace, and all hope had fled. As consciousness returned,
my heart thrilled at the recollection of the miseries
I had endured while floating, a helpless being, on the bosom
of the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I shuddered to think, while I lay feeble as
an infant in the cabin of the vessel which was bearing me
to my home, and whose humane crew had been the means
of my deliverance, that I was still at the mercy of the winds
and waves; but kind nursing, aided by youth and a good
constitution, quickly brought strength; and I was enabled,
after a few days, to come upon deck. On my first attempt,
when my head rose above the deck as I ascended the companion-ladder,
and my eyes fell upon the boundless waste of
waters, a chill of horror shot through my frame. Like a lone
traveller who had suddenly met a lion in his path, I stood
paralysed; every nerve and muscle refused to act. I must
have fallen back into the cabin, had not my hand instinctively
clung to their hold for a few seconds. I could not
withdraw my fixed gaze, while all I had suffered rushed upon
me like a hideous dream. Slowly my faculties returned, when
I ascended the deck, where I sat for a few hours. Each
day after this brought additional strength; so that, before
we made soundings, I was as strong and cheerful as I had
ever been in my life. The weather was squally, and I assisted
the crew as much as was in my power; and, when not
so occupied, lay listlessly looking over the ship's bows that
bravely dashed aside the waves that rolled between me and</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>the home I now longed to reach, or walked the deck musing
upon the joy my return would impart to my over-indulgent
parents.</p>

<p>As we neared the shores of Scotland, a circumstance occurred
that both greatly surprised and alarmed me. This
was a sudden change in the manners and temper of the crew.
Care and anxiety took the place of their wonted cheerfulness;
the joyous laugh, or snatch of song, no longer broke
the monotonous hissing of the waves that rippled along the
sides of the vessel, or the dull whistle of the wind through
the rigging. At the first appearance of every sail that hove
in sight, I could perceive every eye turned to it with a look
of alarm until she was made out. Fearful of giving offence
to my benefactors, I made no remark on the subject for
some time, although I felt disappointed at what I saw&mdash;attributing
it to cowardice; yet they were all stout, young,
resolute-looking fellows at other times. This scene of alarm,
and appearance of a wish to skulk below or conceal themselves,
had occurred twice in the course of the forenoon.
After the last ship we encountered was made out to be a
merchant-brig, I could no longer refrain from delivering my
sentiments of the greater number of the crew, but addressing
the mate, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr Ross, it is fortunate for us that these strange sails
have turned out to be British merchantmen. Had they
proved to be French privateers, we should have made
but a poor stand, I fear, notwithstanding our eight carronades."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" said he.</p>

<p>"Why, there is not a vessel that heaves in sight," said I,
"but the men look as if they wished themselves anywhere
but where they are."</p>

<p>"Avast there, my man!" said he. "What! do you
mean to say that they would not stand by their guns while
there was a chance? Yes, they would, and long after; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
if you think otherwise, all I say is, you form opinions and
talk of what you know nothing about."</p>

<p>Casting an angry look at me&mdash;the only one he ever gave&mdash;he
squirted his quid over the bulwarks, and was walking
away, when I stopped him.</p>

<p>"If I have given you offence, Mr Ross, nothing was
farther from my intention. I cannot but observe the alarm
caused by every sail that heaves in sight until she is made
out to be a friend. Now, the little time I was at sea, before
I fell overboard and was saved by you, every sail that
hove in sight made the hearts of all on board leap for
joy."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" and he laughed aloud. "Are you on that
tack, my messmate? You are quite out in your reckoning,
and becalmed in a fog; but I shall soon blow it away.
There is not a man on board with whom I would not go
into action with the fullest reliance upon his courage; and,
were we to meet a French privateer, you would quickly see
such a change as would satisfy you that my confidence is
not misplaced. Every face, that the moment before expressed
anxiety and alarm, would brighten up with joy; every man
would stand to his gun as cheerfully as to the helm. It
is their liberty the poor fellows are afraid of being deprived
of by our own men-of-war&mdash;the liberty to toil for their
parents or wives where they can get better wages than the
Government allows. Danger, in any form, they meet undaunted
when duty calls; it is for their countrymen they
quail. Were the smallest sloop-of-war in the British navy
to heave in sight, and a boat put off from her with a boy
of a midshipman and eight or ten men, every one on board,
who had not a protection, would shake in his shoes at
her approach; yet, against an enemy, every man would
stand to his gun until his ship was blown out of the water."</p>

<p>A new and painful feeling came over me as he spoke. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was myself an entered seaman, and, of course, liable to impressment;
but the idea of being taken had never occurred
to me. I wondered that it had not, after the scenes I had
witnessed in the frigate; but my longing for home had
entirely engrossed my mind. I was, indeed, home-sick, and
weary of the sea. From this moment, no one on board felt
more alarm than I did at the sight of a top-royal rising out
of the distant waters. My feelings were near akin to those of
a felon in concealment.</p>

<p>At length we reached the Moray Firth, in the evening,
and arrangements were made for as many of the crew as
could be spared to be landed at Cromarty, where the vessel
was to put in. This was to avoid the danger of impressment
in the Firth of Forth. I gave the captain an order
upon my father for my passage, and the expense he had
been at on my account, as I was to leave, with the others in
the boat, as soon as we were off the town, which we hoped
to reach in the morning. My anxiety was so great that I
had kept the deck since nightfall. It was intensely dark;
nothing broke the gloom but the flashes of light that gleamed
for a moment upon the waves, as they rippled along the
sides of the vessel, and the dull rays of the binnacle-lamp
before the man at the helm. Bell after bell was struck, still
I stood at the bows, leaning upon the bowsprit, unmindful
of the chill wind from under the foretopsail, anxiously
watching for the first tints of dawn. Tediously as the
night wore on, I thought, when morning dawned, it had
fled far too fast.</p>

<p>The dark clouds began at length to melt away in the
east, and the distant mountain-tops to rise like grey clouds
above the darkness that still hid the shores from our view.
Gradually the whole face of nature began to emerge from the
morning mists. We were just off the Sutors of Cromarty.
My heart leapt for joy at the near prospect of being once
more on firm ground, and so near home. Several of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
crew had now joined me, and all eyes were directed to the
entrance of the bay. Only a few minutes had elapsed in
this pleasing hope&mdash;for it was still dullish on the horizon&mdash;when
the report of a gun from seaward of us, so near that I
thought it was alongside, made us start and look round.
Each of us seemed as if we had been turned into stone by
the alarming sound; while, so sudden was the revulsion of
feeling, in my own case, that my heart almost ceased to
beat. There, not half-a-league to windward of us, lay a
frigate, with her sails shaking in the wind, and a boat,
well-manned, with an officer in her stern, putting off from her.</p>

<p>So completely were we overcome by the sudden appearance
of this dreaded object, which seemed to emerge from
darkness, as the sun's first rays fell upon and whitened her
sails, that we stood incapable of thought or action. The
well-manned barge was carried, by the faint breeze and
impetus of her oars, almost as swift as a gull on the wing.
The report of the gun brought the captain and mate upon
deck before we had recovered from our stupor.</p>

<p>"Bear a hand, men!" cried Ross, as he sprung upon
deck. "Man the tacklefalls! clear the boat! and give them
a run for it at least."</p>

<p>Roused by his voice, every nerve was strained, the boat
lowered, and we in her, ready to push off, when the captain
called over the side&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lads, do as you think for the best; but it is of no
use to try. The frigate's boat will be under our stern ere
you can gain way."</p>

<p>I stood in the act of pushing off, when the object we
were going to strain every nerve to avoid swept round the
stern, and grappled us. We hopelessly threw our oars
upon the thwarts, and prepared to reascend the vessel, to
settle with the captain and bring away our chests. As for
myself, I had no call to leave the boat. All I possessed in
the world was upon my person, and half-a-guinea given me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
by the captain to carry me home. The other three were
getting their bags and chests ready to lower into the boat,
having got their wages from the captain, when he called me
to come on deck. I obeyed; when he said to the midshipman
in command of the boat&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, to prevent any unpleasant consequences arising to
this poor fellow, Elder, here, I shall let you know how he
came on board of us. He belonged to the <i>Latona</i>, and is
no deserter, I assure you. Ross, bring here our log-book,
and satisfy the gentleman if he wishes." Ross obeyed; and
having examined it, the captain told the wretched state in
which I had been picked up, and the way in which I had
accounted to him for the accident. During the recital, he
looked hard at me, no muscle of his face indicating either
pity or surprise. When the captain ceased to speak, he only
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, you have for once had a narrow escape&mdash;you
must hold better on in future. I shall report to the
captain, and get the D from before your name. Tumble
into the boat, my lads. Good day, captain." And, in a
few minutes afterwards, I was on board the <i>Edgar</i>, seventy-four,
and standing westwards for the Firth of Forth.</p>

<p>It was strange the change that came over the impressed
men, when there was no longer any hope of escape. Like
true seamen, they bent to the circumstance they could not
remedy, and were, as soon as they got on board, as much at
home, and more cheerful, than they had been for many days
before. As for myself, I took it much to heart, and was
very melancholy when we entered the Firth and stood up to
the roadstead. I could hardly restrain my feelings when
the city of Edinburgh came in sight, and when I thought
of the short distance in miles that divided me from my
parents and home&mdash;that home I had left so foolishly in
the hopes of being back at the conclusion of the war, which
I now found was raging more furiously, if possible, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
when I left, and with much less prospect of its termination.
I would stand for hours gazing upon the White Craig, the
eastern extremity of the Pentland Hills, and wish I was
upon it, until my eyes were suffused with tears. I begged
hard for the first lieutenant to give me leave to go on shore,
if only for eight-and-forty hours, to visit my parents; but
he refused my request, fearful of my not returning. Several
of the hands on board, natives of Edinburgh, who had
been long in the <i>Edgar</i>, obtained leave. With one of them
I sent a letter to my father, who came the following day.
It was a meeting of sorrow, not unmixed with upbraidings,
on his part, for what I had done; but we parted with
regret&mdash;he to do what he could to obtain my discharge, I
under promise not to act so precipitately in future, if I was
once more a free agent. What steps were taken I know
not, for next morning we received orders to sail for the
Nore. We had many faces on board that looked as long as
my own, for there were still several who had obtained promise
of leave whose turn had not come round. Wallace,
one of the mess I was in, had not been in his native city
for ten years, having been all that time voluntarily on board
of men-of-war, either at home or on foreign stations. He
was to have had two days' leave the very morning we
sailed, and had doomed ten gold guineas, which he had
long kept for such purpose, to be expended in a blow-out
in Edinburgh, among his relations and friends. When
the boatswain piped to weigh anchor, Wallace, who was
captain of the foretop, ran to his berth, opened his chest,
took out his long-hoarded store, and came on deck with it
in his hand. His looks bespoke rage and disappointment,
bordering upon insanity. He gazed upon the distant city
that shone upon the gently swelling hills glancing back the
sun's rays, then at the purse of gold in his hand. He
seemed incapable of speech. A bitter smile curled his
lip, bespeaking the most intense scorn. I looked on, wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
what he meant to do. It was but the scene of a
minute. Suddenly raising his hand, he threw the purse
and gold over the side with all his force, exclaiming:&mdash;"Go,
vile trash! what use have I for you now? The first
action may lay me low!" Then, as if relieved from some
oppressive load, he mounted the rattlings to his duty with
a smile of satisfaction; and we bore away for the Nore,
where I was draughted on board the <i>Repulse</i>, sixty-four,
and departed upon a cruise along the coast of Brittany; at
times lying off Brest harbour, and at others, standing along
the coast in search of the enemy. Employed in this monotonous
duty, month followed month, and year after year
passed away.</p>

<p>It was now the year 1799. The century was drawing
to a close; but the interminable war seemed only commencing.
I had become almost callous to my fate. We
were standing along, under a steady breeze, as close in
shore as we could with safety to the vessel. It was the
dog-watch; and I had only been a short time turned in
when our good ship struck upon some sunken rocks with
such force that I thought she had gone to pieces. Every
one in a moment turned out. The night was as dark as
pitch, and the sea breaking over us, while we lay hard and
fast. Everything was done to lighten her in vain. She
was making water very fast, in spite of all our exertions at
the pumps. Still there was not the smallest confusion on
board. Our discipline was as strict, and our officers as
promptly obeyed, as they were before our accident. As the
tide rose, the wind shifted, and blew a gale right upon the
shore, causing the ship to beat violently. Day at length
dawned, and there, not one hundred fathoms from our deck,
lay a rocky and desolate-looking shore. We had been
forced over a reef of sunken rocks that were not in our
charts; and, during the darkness, as was supposed, had
been carried in-shore by some current; but, however it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
happened, there we were, in a serious scrape, the sea breaking
over our decks, and our hold full of water.</p>

<p>Soon after daybreak we could perceive the peasantry
crowding down to the water's edge. Everything had been
done that skill and resolution could accomplish, to save the
vessel, but in vain. We had nothing before our eyes but
instant death. The sea ran so high that no boat could live
for a moment in the broken water between us and the shore.
The French peasantry were making no effort for our safety,
but running about and looking on our deplorable situation,
with apparently no other feeling than that of curiosity. At
this time, James Paterson, an Edinburgh lad, volunteered
to make the attempt to swim to the shore with a log-line,
and fearlessly let himself over the side. It was, to all appearance,
a hopeless attempt; for every one felt assured
that he would be beat to death against the rocks that lined
the beach, on which the waves were beating with great
fury.</p>

<p>It was a period of fearful suspense; yet, dreadful as our
situation was, there was not the least unnecessary noise on
board. All was prompt attention and obedience. The
weather was extremely cold, and the sea, at times, making
a complete breach over the ship, which we expected every
moment to go to pieces. As for myself, I meant to stow
below and perish with her, rather than to float about,
bruised and maimed, and drown at last. One half of
the crew were only dressed in their shirts and trousers,
without shoes or stockings, as they had leaped from their
hammocks. When she struck, we had no leisure to put on
more than our trousers. Thus we stood, holding on by the
nettings, or anything we could lay hold of, to prevent our
being washed off the decks, with our eyes anxiously watching
the progress of the brave Paterson, who swam like an otter,
the boatswain and his mates serving out the line to him.
We saw him near the rocks, and the people making signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to him. This was the point of greatest danger, but, by the
aid of the peasants, he surmounted it.</p>

<p>Those on the beach gave a shout, which we replied to
from the deck. A hawser was made fast to the line, and
secured on shore. It was not until now that we began to
hope; and with this hope arose an anxiety on the part of
every one to save what they could. I strove to reach my
chest, in which were a pair of new shoes and five guineas,
but my efforts, like those of the others, were vain; our
under decks were flooded several inches, and everything was
loose and knocking about in the most furious manner, from
the rolling and pitching of the vessel upon the rocks, so
that I was but too happy to reach the decks without being
crushed to death. All I regretted was my shoes; the money
I cared not for, and do not think I would have taken it,
as we expected to be plundered as soon as we got to the
beach.</p>

<p>After a great deal of fatigue, we all got safe to land, and
now the plundering began. There were no regular soldiers
on the spot, but a great many of the peasantry had firelocks
and bayonets, and stood over us, stripping those of the men,
who had them, of their jackets and hats. At first, we were
disposed to resist, but soon found it to be of no use. One
of the fellows seized the chain of the watch belonging to one
of our men, and was in the act of pulling it from the pocket,
when the owner, Jack Smith, struck him to the ground with
a blow of his fist. The next moment poor Smith lay a lifeless
corpse upon the sand, felled by a stroke from the butt
end of a musket.</p>

<p>There was no one present who seemed to have or who
assumed any authority, to whom our officers might appeal
for protection; they were not more respected than the men;
all were searched and robbed as soon as they arrived from
the wreck. Poor Smith's fate taught us submission, even
while our bosoms burned with a desire for vengeance. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of my messmates said aloud&mdash;"I would cheerfully stand
before the muzzle of one of the old <i>Repulse's</i> thirty-twos,
were she charged to the mouth with grape well laid, to
sweep these French robbers from the face of the earth." As
for myself, they took nothing from me. I had twopence in
the pocket of my trousers; when I saw what was going on,
I took it out and held it in my hand while they searched
me. I more than once thought they were going to strip me
of my nether garments, and give me in exchange a pair of
their own gun-mouthed rags, which would scarcely have
reached my knees; for several of them looked at them as if
they felt inclined to make the exchange; but I escaped, and
felt thankful.</p>

<p>We stood for several hours shivering upon the beach
without food, fire, or water, while the plunderers were busy
picking up anything that drifted ashore, but still keeping a
strict watch over us; at length, the chief magistrate of a
neighbouring small town arrived, and to him our officers
complained of the usage we had received. He only shook
his head, and shrugged his shoulders, when the body of
Smith was pointed out to him. What could we do? A
grave was dug for him on the spot where he was murdered,
and we were marched off into the interior. It was well on
in the afternoon before we reached the place where we were to
halt. It was a small poverty-stricken-like town, with an old
ruinous church and churchyard, surrounded by high walls,
with an iron gate close by. Into this chill, desolate place,
we were crowded by the soldiers, the gate locked upon us, and
sentinels placed around the building. Here we remained until
the evening, when there was served out to every man a
small loaf, black as mud; yet, black as it was, I never
ate a sweeter morsel; for neither I nor any of my companions
had tasted any food since the evening before.</p>

<p>But how shall I express the horror we felt when we
found we were to remain where we were, in this old, ruined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
charnel-house of a church, which could scarcely contain us
all, unless we stood close together. To lie down was out
of the question; and, although we could, there were neither
straw, blankets, nor covering of any kind, to screen us from
the cold. We implored in vain to be removed; but these
privations, bad as they were, did not annoy us so much as
the idea of spending the long dark night in such a miserable
place. By far the greater number of us believed as firmly
in the reality of ghosts as we did in our own existence; and,
of all places in the world, a church and churchyard, from
time immemorial, have been their favourite haunts, and
the terror of all who believe in their reality&mdash;even those who
affect to disbelieve in the visits of spirits to this earth, feel
sensations which they would not choose to own, when in a
churchyard, in a dark night, with gravestones and crumbling
human bones around them. Of all men seamen are the
most superstitious, and give the most ready credence to
ghost stories. The unmanning feeling of fear, that had not
touched a single heart in the extremity of our danger from
the storm, was now strongly marked in every face, exaggerated
by a horror of we knew not what. Fear is contagious&mdash;we
huddled together, and peered fearfully around, expecting
every moment to see some appalling vision or hear some
dreadful sound. Our sense of hearing was painfully acute&mdash;the
smallest noise made us start; but our feelings were
too much racked to remain long at the same intensity&mdash;they
gradually became more obtuse as the night wore on, until
we at length began to entertain each other with fearful
stories of ghosts; feeling a strange satisfaction in increasing
the gloomy excitement under which we laboured. Had any
of us begun a humorous story, with the view of diverting
our thoughts from their present bent, and the circumstances
we were in, I am certain he would have been silenced in no
gentle manner.</p>

<p>We might have been about two hours or less in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
state, in the most intense darkness&mdash;our own whispers being
all that we could recognise of each other, even although in
contact&mdash;when a low pleasant murmur suddenly fell upon
our ears: It was the voice of Dick Bates, who, having either
been requested, or, moved by his present situation, had, of
his own accord, commenced singing in an under tone his
favourite ballad of "Hozier's Ghost." Now, Dick was the
best singer in the whole crew, with a voice like a singing
bird; it was at this moment so low that, had it been broad
daylight, he would have appeared only to have been breathing
hard; yet it was at this time distinctly heard by all, and
made our flesh creep upon our bones, although a strange
kind of pleasure was mingled with the feeling. We scarcely
breathed when he came to the lines&mdash;</p>

<div style="padding-left:25%">
"With three thousand ghosts beside him,<br />
And in groans did Vernon hail&mdash;<br />
Heed, O heed my fatal story,<br />
I am Hozier's injured Ghost."<br />
</div>

<p>I thought the whole was present before me, and I could see
the scene the poet described, and shuddered when he breathed
forth&mdash;</p>

<div style="padding-left:25%">
"See these ghastly spectres sweeping<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mournful o'er this hated wave,</span><br />
Whose pale cheeks are stained with weeping&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These were English captains brave.</span><br />
<br />
"See these numbers pale and horrid!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These were once my seamen bold.</span><br />
Lo! each hangs his drooping forehead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While his mournful tale is told."</span><br />
</div>

<p>I believe there was not a man in the old church who did
not think he saw the ghastly train of spectres flitting before
his eyes, and who did not feel every nerve thrill, and every
hair of his head stand on end. Many were the tales of
superstition and of terror related, until overpowered nature
sank into sleep; but I have since often reflected that, of all
the accounts of fearful sights I heard, they were all related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
at second hand, from the authority of others. No one
asserted they themselves had ever seen anything out of
the ordinary course of nature except Bob Nelson, and his
was calculated to lead a more prejudiced observer astray. It
was as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was during a voyage I made to New York from
Greenock, in the brig <i>Cochrane</i>, that I once saw, with my
own eyes, a strange sight, such as I hope never to witness
again. Our cargo consisted of dry goods, and we had
several emigrants as passengers; in particular, a family of
six in the cabin, the husband and wife, with four children;
they were wealthy, and had sold off their farm stock to purchase
land, and settle somewhere in America. When they
came on board at the quay of Greenock, they were accompanied
by a great many relations and friends, who took a
most affectionate leave of them; in particular one old woman,
the mother of the emigrant's wife. Her wailings were
most pitiable; she wrung her hands, and stood as if rooted
to our decks. I heard her say more than once&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Mary, I feel I shall never see you more, nor these
lovely babes. O why will you leave your aged mother to
go mourning to her grave?'</p>

<p>"Her daughter looked more like one dead than alive, as
she lay sobbing upon the breast of her husband, her mother
holding one of her hands between both of her's. Poor soul,
she looked as if her heart was breaking, but spoke not; at
length, the husband said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'O woman, have you no feeling for your daughter?'</p>

<p>"The old woman's grief seemed, all at once, turned into
rage: she let her daughter's hand drop, and, raising her
hands, cursed him for depriving her of her daughter; concluding
with&mdash;</p>

<p>"'But, James, remember what I say; dead or alive, I
shall yet see my Mary.'</p>

<p>"The poor young woman was carried below in a faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and the old dame was conveyed from the deck by the friends,
for we were by this time cast loose, and leaving our berth.
For several days I saw nothing of the farmer's family, as
they were very sick; but the children had now begun to
play about the deck, and their father would leave the cabin
for a short time, once or twice a-day, for his wife remained
very ill, and confined to her bed. The haglike appearance
of the old woman, in her rage, had made a great impression
on me, and had evidently sunk the spirits of the young
people; for I often saw, when the husband came on deck,
that he was much dejected. I felt it strange that the
figure of the old woman often occurred to my mind when I
looked at him; and I several times dreamed I saw her in
my sleep, as I had seen her in Greenock, but her appearance
was more pale and hideous, and had so great an effect
upon me, that I always awoke in an agony, and cursed her
from my heart.</p>

<p>"About mid-passage we met with westerly gales and rough
weather, which caused the passengers to keep below for
several days, and retarded our passage much. It was blowing
very hard. It was my turn at the wheel. In the midwatch
we had occasional showers. The clouds were scudding
along in immense bodies over the face of the moon,
which was just at the full, so that we had, at times, bright
moonlight for a minute or two, then gloom; but the night
was not dark. I might have been at the wheel half my time
or so. My eye was fixed ahead to watch the set of the
waves, save when I glanced to the compass. I thought I
saw something upon the bowsprit in the gloom that was
not there a moment before. I looked aloft to see for a
break in the clouds that the moon might shew me more distinctly
what it was. I looked ahead again, and there it still
was, but nearer the bows of the vessel. Still I could not
make out what it was. Soon a burst of moonlight shone
forth, and I saw it resembled a human figure, but whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
man or woman I could not tell, for the moon was as suddenly
obscured as it had shone forth. I felt very queer;
being certain it was none of the crew&mdash;for the whole watch
was aft at the time&mdash;and I was sure that all the passengers
were below, and no one had come on deck since the watch
had been changed. I looked at the spot where I had seen
it, and it was gone. I felt the greatest inclination to tell
what I had seen; but the fear of being laughed at, made me
say nothing of it at this time; I, however, never wished so
much for anything in my life as that my spell at the wheel
was over, and the watch passed. When, at length, I was
released, I crept to the foxa, and tumbled into my hammock,
but could not close an eye for thinking of what I had seen.</p>

<p>"Well, my mates, I was then, as I am now, in a pretty
mess, and wished myself as heartily out of the <i>Cochrane</i> as
we all do ourselves out of this old foundered hulk of a
church. I was fairly aground with fear, and felt all of a
tremble for the nights I must pass on board before we
reached New York, where I was determined to leave the
brig if I saw any more such sights. For a few days the
gale continued, sometimes blowing very hard, at others
more moderate, but nothing uncommon occurred. At length
it abated, and we had pleasant weather. I began to think
I had been deceived, and was glad I had not spoken of
what I had seen to any of the crew. It was the afternoon,
towards evening. I was again at the wheel. The sun
was setting in a bed of clouds, as gaily coloured as a ship
rejoicing&mdash;the colours of all nations floating aloft, from the
point of her bowsprit to the end of her jib-boom. The
four children were playing upon deck, laughing and full of
joy at being once more relieved from their long confinement
in the cabin. I looked at their innocent gambols and at
the beautiful sky by turns, as much as my duty would
allow, and felt more happy than I had done since we sailed.
It was so pleasant to look ahead; for every face on deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
wore a pleasing and happy aspect. I looked again at the
children's gambols; but I almost dropped at the wheel.
My hands and limbs refused to do their office. There, before
me, close by the children, stood the exact representation
of the old woman&mdash;so stern, so unearthly was her look,
that I cannot express it; but she was pale as the foam on
the crest of a wave. I could not call out. I had no
power either to move tongue or limb. The yawing of the
vessel called the attention of the mate to me, who sung out
to hold her steady. I heard him, but could not obey.
My whole faculties were engrossed by the fearful vision.
My eyes appeared as if they would have started out of my
head. One of the crew seized the wheel. All looked at
me with astonishment. I stood rivetted to the spot, pointing
to where the spectre stood; but no one saw anything
but myself. The captain was below in the cabin, with the
farmer and his wife&mdash;the latter of whom was known to all
the crew to be very ill. As I looked to the unearthly figure,
attracted by a power I could not resist, the children continued
their play. The features of the old woman, I thought,
relaxed, and a sadness came over them, but it was of unearthly
expression. The figure glided from the children to
the cabin-companion, and disappeared below, when it as
suddenly came again upon deck, accompanied by the farmer's
wife, pale and wasted. Both gazed upon the children.
The young woman appeared to wring her hands in great
distress, as I had seen her before she was carried below;
but the old woman hurried her over the side of the brig,
and I saw no more of them. When they disappeared, my
faculties returned. I trembled as if I had been in an ague,
and the cold sweat stood in large drops upon my forehead.
The mate and crew thought that I had been in a fit, until I
told them what I had seen. They looked rather serious,
but were much inclined to laugh at me. The mate began
to jaw me a little on my fancies. All had passed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
minute or two. Scarce had the mate spoken a dozen of
words, when the captain hurried upon deck, much affected,
and called to one of the female steerage passengers to go
instantly to the cabin and assist, as he feared the farmer's
wife was dead. The mate ceased to speak, and the rest of
the crew looked as amazed as I did at the strange occurrence.
The captain came to us. When he heard my strange
story, he shook his head, and only said it was a remarkable
occurrence; but I had been deceived by some illusion, and
commanded us not to speak of it, for distressing the poor
husband. We resolved to obey him, as we were by this
time nearly in with the land, and expected to make it next
day, which we did; and the poor farmer was helped ashore,
almost as death-like as the body of his wife, which was
buried in New York. I sailed several trips afterwards in
the <i>Cochrane</i>, but never saw anything out of the common
afterwards in her or anywhere else."</p>

<p>The first rays of the rising sun shone upon us all sound
asleep, as quiet and undisturbed as if we had passed the
night under the roofs of our fathers' houses; but I was
cold, stiff, and sore when I awoke. I had passed the night
upon a flat gravestone outside of the church, for want of
room within, without any covering but my shirt and trousers&mdash;all
I had saved from the wreck. There was not a character
engraved on the stone that was not as distinctly
marked on my body. It was of no use grumbling or being
cast down&mdash;we were fairly adrift, and must go with the
current. It was now that the buoyancy of a sailor's mind
burst forth. The old church and churchyard resounded
with shouts and laughter, that made the French sentinels
think we had all gone mad. Some were busy at leap-frog,
others were pursuing each other among the ruins and tomb-stones&mdash;all
were in active exertion for the sake of warmth,
and to beguile the time; while the French gathered outside
wherever they could obtain a sight of us, and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
on in amazement at our frolics. I am certain they were not
without fear for us; for a few of the lads had contrived to
clamber to the top of the ruins; and were amusing themselves
by antics, at the hazard of their necks, and throwing
small pieces of lime at us below. The officer in command
called to them to come down; but they knew not what he
said. Some of them cried out, in answer to his call&mdash;"Speak
like a Christian if you want us to understand you,
and don't wow like a dog." At this moment, Nick Williams,
one of our maintop men, had scaled the highest point
of the walls, and had, at the risk of his life, contrived to
perch himself upon the crumbling stone, and was huzzaing
most vociferously. It was a daring and foolhardy feat. A
shout of admiration rose from the outside of the walls, when
a real British cheer answered it from within. Whether the
officer was enraged at the apparent defiance and disobedience
to his commands, I know not, but several muskets
were fired through the rails of the gate, and the balls recoiled
from the walls. A shout of rage burst from us; and a serious
conflict was only prevented by the prudence of the petty
officers who were among us; for the enraged seamen had
begun to collect stones from the base of the ruined walls to
hurl at the dastardly guards, who were shouting, <i>"Vive la
Nation!" "Vive la Republique!"</i> Our boatswain, who was
a cool and resolute old tar, seeing that the storm was still
on the verge of bursting out&mdash;for we looked upon their cries
as insulting as their balls&mdash;by a happy thought, struck up
the national air, "God save the King," which we sung with
an enthusiasm and strength of lungs never, I am certain,
surpassed before or since. If it had no melody, it had a
tone and sound equivalent to both. Many who still held
the stones in their hands, which they had lifted to hurl at
the guards, struck them together like cymbals, in regular
time, to increase the noise. The effect was most exhilarating
and produced the desired effect of turning our angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
feeling into good-humour. So pleased were we, that we
gave them "Rule Britannia" in the same style, until we
forgot, in our enthusiasm, that we were prisoners, hungry,
cold, and naked. Scarce had the last loud cadence died
away, when the gate was thrown open, and a miserable
allowance of the same black bread was served out to
us, with plenty of water, and the gate once more shut
against us.</p>

<p>It was very strange that, among more than five hundred
of us, not one knew a word of French, and there were none
of those who entered the enclosure could speak a word of
English, so that we knew not what those who had the
power over us meant to do. We conjectured that they intended
to keep us where we were until we were exchanged;
and had already begun to canvass the possibility of breaking
out of the hated church and yard, and making a bold push
for our liberty, in the following night, by overpowering our
guards, seizing their arms, and passing along the coast,
until we reached some of the small ports, and making
prizes of all the vessels in it, and setting sail for England.
A council was actually deliberating in the church, composed
of the petty officers and a few of our picked hands, when
our attention was roused by the sound of martial music
approaching the churchyard, where it halted, and we were
soon after turned out, and numbered to the officer in
command.</p>

<p>The party who had just arrived consisted of two companies
of soldiers of the line, regularly clothed and armed, as
the French troops were; while those under whose charge
we had been were only the armed peasantry of the neighbourhood.
We hoped the change would be for our advantage.
We saw at once we were going to be conveyed into the
interior. Go where we must, we felt we could not be worse
fed, lodged, or used than we had been. No harsh word
was used to us by the regular troops; and, before we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
been a few hours on the road, we understood each other well
enough by dumb show, and marched on in good humour;
we walking in the middle of them like a drove of bullocks,
as frolicsome as children, singing, laughing, and putting
practical jokes upon each other, to beguile the way. Scarce
had we travelled a couple of miles, until my bare feet became
sore from the small stones and bruises; yet I limped
on in the best manner I could, and as cheerfully as possible.
I was in the front as we were on the point of entering
a village; the soldiers in file enclosing us on either side,
and bringing up the rear, so that we could not walk faster
or slower than they chose. A few hundred yards from the
entrance of the village, those in front turned round, and
pointing to the fowls of various kinds that were feeding on
the highway before us, made signs which we readily understood,
and nodded significantly; they then drew to each
side of the road, and we behind them, leaving a gap in the
middle of the way like the prongs of a fork closed at the
base. The ducks, hens, and other fowls became alarmed as
we came close upon them, and ran for shelter to the vacant
space in the middle, when the front closed, and all were
secured by those in the centre; the poor people, their
owners, calling in vain for restitution of their property.
The soldiers would not allow them to come within their
ranks; and, at night, when we stopped, the former procured
wood for us to dress the stolen fowls, after having received
their proportion. This, I confess, was a species of robbery;
but we were starved by the allowance of government, and
we were in an enemy's country, who had plundered the
shipwrecked mariner cast upon their shores. We thought,
therefore, although, of course, the reasoning was wrong, that,
in appropriating whatever we could lay hands upon, we
were merely making fair and just reprisals for the losses we
had sustained at the hands of our captors; but, the truth is,
we troubled ourselves very little about the right or wrong of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the matter, for we were lodged either in large empty barns,
or ruined churches, all the way to Rennes, and could, from
hunger, have eaten a jackass when we were allowed to
rest for the night. Even yet, I remember the relish a small
piece of a roast pig or fowl had, without either bread or salt,
at this time, for we were not scrupulous what we lifted that
would eat, if we could carry it. In one village, five pigs
disappeared in this manner, and only the great weight of
the parent prevented her following them. At the time, it
had not the appearance of theft; there was so much fun in it
that it resembled a great hunt, for every eye was in quest of
game, and all was done so quietly and dexterously that there
was not the least confusion or noise. We closed so rapidly
that the prey had no means of escape, nor room to move
until it was despatched; yet the people, as we passed, were
often very kind to us, so far as was in their power, for they
appeared to be miserably poor. When we reached Rennes
my feet were so sore, swelled, and cut, that I walked with
great pain; numbers of us were in the same situation. We
did not pass straight through the town, but were halted, for
some time, in the market-place, while the inhabitants came
in crowds to gaze at the English prisoners; and a miserable
sight we were. We might have been here about half an
hour, when a beautiful young lady came to where we were,
with a young woman behind her carrying a large basket
filled with shoes. I thought she had come to sell them, as
so many were barefoot. I saw her giving them to the men,
and hirpled to the spot, and looked with an anxious eye at
the store which was diminishing fast. I had still retained
the twopence, and resolved to make an effort to obtain
a pair, but felt backward, conscious I had no equivalent to
give for them; holding out my coppers, I pointed to a pair
which I thought would answer me; I felt ashamed, and
looked to the ground, pointing to my feet when I had attracted
her attention, for she was looking in another direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
She took the shoes and gave them to me. I proffered
my little cash; she gently put my hand aside, and, by a sign,
made me know that I was welcome to them. I never saw
a female so lovely as this young lady; her clear, black eyes
were swimming in tears, and her face covered with blushes;
her looks were so mild, so benevolent, she looked like an
angel sent from heaven to administer to our wants. Never
before or since have I felt the same sensation so intensely.
It was delightful; it was painful. I felt a choking in my
throat. I could have wept, and have found relief in it, but
I was surrounded by those who would have made sport of
my emotion. I retired a few paces to make way for others,
in silence. I dared not utter a sound, lest my feelings had
overpowered me, but stood and gazed at the lovely creature
until she retired. I felt as if everything to be esteemed on
earth was concentrated in her person and mind. Had I been
an admiral I would have gloried in calling her mine; had
it been necessary I could have faced death or any danger, to
free her from trouble or grief, with a feeling of joy and
exultation. Many a time has this fair creature been embodied
in my mind's eye, as fair and lovely as she was then,
but I never saw her again.</p>

<p>Many others of the good inhabitants of Rennes administered
to our wants. I got, besides the shoes, a substitute
for a jacket, and a straw hat from an old man. Indeed, we
saw in our route scarce any others except old men, women,
and boys. Women were driving the carts, and working in
the fields, and doing the work done by the men in Britain.
From Rennes we were marched to Perche, our final destination,
in the same manner as we had been from the coast,
and lodged in prison; but I found it no prison to me:
men were so scarce at this time in France that we were
allowed to work out of prison if we chose, and only visited
once a-week to pass muster, and receive our allowance&mdash;so
I soon found a master, or, more properly, he found me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
prison&mdash;a cart and plough-wright residing a short distance
from town.</p>

<p>Citizen Vauquin, in secret, was a staunch Royalist; but,
in his common conversation, a Republican. To me he was
extremely kind, but our communications were very limited,
from my want of knowledge of French; but I was picking
it up with rapidity, and we soon contrived to understand
each other pretty well.</p>

<p>It was now well on in the spring, and the weather warm
and agreeable. I was busy at my work, when Vauquin,
who was a stout, hale old man, came to me; there was something
comic in the expression of his countenance, joy and
vexation seemed by turns to pass over it, and at times to
struggle for mastery; he looked cautiously around lest any
one might overhear us, then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, France! beautiful France! these cursed Democrats
have dimmed your glory, and ruined you! We have lost
our fleet in Egypt, and we fly before the Germans. What
can we have but defeat, while the best blood in France
either has been shed by her sons, or languishes in obscurity.
Could we be freed from the ruffians that tyrannize over us
in any way but this? We have suffered much, and must
suffer more, before we see the glories of France shine as
they once shone in the courts of her kings. Ha! Elder,
your sailors are the devils that humble France; from your
riches the seas are covered with your ships, and the brave
French, plundered by their rulers, have few. What could
be done with sixteen ships when fifty were upon them?"</p>

<p>Piqued by his national vanity, I replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Had Nelson had half the number, there would have
been no fighting."</p>

<p>"Why no fighting, Monsieur?" said he.</p>

<p>"Because they would have run if they could," replied I;
"or struck when they saw no chance&mdash;that's all I have to
say on the subject. If you please let us change it, my friend."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"By all means," said he, "let us change it. We are a
ruined and undone people since we lost our King. The
great nation are a people without a head; and, when a
house wants the head, all goes wrong."</p>

<p>"You and I are at one on this point," replied I. "But
how comes it that you are as democratic as any one in the
neighbourhood when politics is the subject of discourse?
It is not so in Britain. Every man speaks his mind; yet
we have a king and a kingly government. I was led to
believe, before I left home, that in France alone there was
liberty: for all men were equal&mdash;freedom and equality
being the law of the land."</p>

<p>"O Monsieur Elder!" exclaimed he, "freedom and
equality are the worst tyranny, as I shall shew you by my
sad experience. When all men make the law, who is to
obey? Better one tyrant than one million; for, when
every one thinks he is a law-maker, no one thinks of obeying
the law farther than it pleases himself. Listen to me;
and you shall hear the truth as I have experienced it, and
many thousands in France as well as I:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When first the people of France began to give attention
to the writers and haranguers against the oppression
which we, no doubt, suffered, no one was more enthusiastic
than I was for the removal of the abuses; and I thought
no sacrifice could be too great to have them removed. I
was, at the time, carpenter to the great chateau which you
see in the distance. Our old lord, who was a severe master,
had died only a few years before, and had not the love of a
single peasant in his wide domains; but his son was the
reverse of his parent&mdash;the friend and benefactor of every
one on his estate; yet he inherited a fund of animosity
which it would have taken years of his kindness and
humanity to have obliterated. In this state of matters,
the troubles broke out. He was on the side of the people,
and aided, as far as in him lay, the cause of improvement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the state, until the factions in Paris&mdash;who, ruling the silly
multitude, led them to believe that they were ruled by
them&mdash;struck at the root of all good government by insulting
and imprisoning the King. From this time, he took
no active part in the commotions, but remained at his
chateau. I was his overseer, and managed his affairs. I
loved him with all my soul, for he was worthy of my love.
My ideas went still farther than his went, and I felt not
displeased with anything that had as yet occurred; for I
knew the tenacity with which the aristocracy clung to their
privileges; but the cunning and designing men who, under
the faint shew of obeying the people, ruled them at their
will for mischief and disorder, ultimately, by taking the
life of the King, took the key-stone out of the arch which
sheltered the people, and brought the whole fabric of civil
order about their ears. I was confounded at the blindness
I had laboured under; and, from that hour, my whole ideas
changed. But, alas! it was too late; and even those that
had lent a willing hand trembled at the mischief they had
done. Benefits are soon forgot; but the remembrance of
injuries are indelible. Numbers of needy plunderers had
arrived from Paris, and overspread these peaceful plains like
evil spirits, rousing the worst feeling of our peasantry into
action. As yet, no serious outrage had been committed in
this quarter; but I too plainly saw that it would not long
be deferred. I requested my dear master to fly, as many
others had done; for blood had begun to flow like water in
Paris and the provinces&mdash;not the blood of the guilty, but
the blood of the noble and virtuous; for, alas! France had
become the arena in the remorseless war of poverty against
property. The whole fabric of social order had been dissolved,
and men had returned to their original state of
barbarism; like jackalls or wolves, only banding together
when they scented plunder. To be rich or nobly born was
a crime of the deepest dye, only to be atoned by blood. I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
with extreme pain, saw the storm gathering, and could only
deplore it; and what added to my anguish, was, I dared not
argue against them; for our old and worthy magistrates had
been deposed, and others, more in the spirit of the times,
appointed. As yet, no blood had been shed in Perche, but
numbers were immured in prison; and, had I given the
least cause of suspicion, I would have been placed beyond
the power of lending that aid to the distressed which I was
resolved to afford them, or perish in the attempt. Several
times I had entreated my young lord to fly, and avoid the
storm; but my entreaties were in vain. He thought far
too well of his fellow-men.</p>

<p>"At length a rumour reached us that two commissioners
were on their way to the chateau to sequestrate it for the
use of the state: immediately there was a violent commotion
amongst the people&mdash;fearful of losing their share of
the plunder, all marched in a tumultuous manner to assault
it. Aware of what might ensue&mdash;for blood had begun to
flow&mdash;I got my young lord disguised as one of my workmen,
and set to his bench&mdash;that very one at which you work&mdash;and
joined the crowd as they approached the chateau. To
prevent suspicion, no one shouted louder than I, 'Down
with the Tyrants!'&mdash;'Down with the Aristocrats!'&mdash;'<i>Vive
la Nation!</i>'&mdash;'<i>Vive la Republique!</i>' We entered the
chateau, which was searched in vain for my young lord.
It was now that the true spirit of the peasantry shewed itself
in all its deformity; everything of value was in a short
time carried off or destroyed; while every quarter resounded
with execrations and cries for blood&mdash;the oppressions of
the father were alone remembered. How it occurred I have
yet to learn, but the youthful aristocrat was discovered in
my shop; this was a severe blow to me, for I was immediately
seized by the furious crowd, charged by them
with the worst of crimes in their eyes, the concealing from
them a victim of their rage. It was a fearful hour. I expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to have been torn to pieces upon the spot. My
presence of mind did not forsake me: I begged to be heard
before the fatal daggers that were brandished around reached
my heart. I stood firm until a pause of the storm, when I
appealed to them not for mercy, but for revenge&mdash;revenge
upon my lord before I died. "I have been betrayed," I
cried, "by some one. I appeal to yourselves for my former
love of my country. Let me die, but let it be for my country,
and let me be revenged upon the tyrants. Fire the chateau!&mdash;'<i>Vive
la Nation</i>,' '<i>A bas les Aristocrats</i>,' '<i>Vive la Republique</i>'&mdash;and
let me die by the light of the stronghold of
tyranny enveloped in flames."</p>

<p>"I now breathed more freely. Shouts rent the air; for
like a weathercock is a mob&mdash;ever pointing as the last breath
of wind blows. '<i>Vive Vauquin!</i>' resounded from every
lip; the chateau was enveloped in flames; its owner immersed
in a dungeon to await his doom, already fixed before
the mock forms of justice were gone through. Think
not the worse of me for the part I acted; every paper and
article of plate had been concealed for some days before.
To save, if possible, his life, no one was louder in denouncing
my lord than myself, for his having dared to conceal
himself in my shop. At my return, I began seriously to
turn over in my mind what steps I was next to pursue for
his safety, now rendered difficult, almost beyond my power
to overcome. I feared not death, nor any danger to myself,
could my object have been attained by it. There was
not a moment to be lost; the following day was to have
been the day of his trial and death. The commissioners
had arrived from Paris, and a fte was resolved to be got
up to welcome them. In a state of anxiety I can hardly
describe, I bustled about and waited upon the commissioners;
but my chief object was to ascertain the exact spot
where the aristocrats were confined. My lord was my
chiefest care, for however much I had, at the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the revolution, wished for the abused power of the
nobles to be reduced, I had no wish for their ruin, far less
their murder; judge my horror when I learned that he was
in the lower dungeon of the prison, to which there was only
one entrance through the guard-room, which was constantly
filled by the soldiers on guard. With a heart void of hope
I returned to my home. In an agony of mind I threw myself
upon my couch, that if possible I might exclude every
other thought but the one that I wished to fix my whole
attention upon: while I walked about, I felt like one distracted.
At length, I was so fortunate as to call to mind
having, when a boy, heard my father tell that he had assisted
my grandfather in securing a door into the lower dungeon,
that led into another even more loathsome, where
the Huguenots were wont to be confined in the time of
Louis the Fourteenth; this had a door which led into the
outer court of the prison, the walls of which were in the
hinder part, ruinous and neglected, as few of the present
people in authority knew of such a dungeon; the old door
having been long built up. A faint ray of hope shot
through my mind; I started from my bed, and, concealing
what tools I judged to be necessary, proceeded to the jail
without being perceived&mdash;this was rendered the more easy
as every one was engaged preparing for the fte. I remained
under the shelter of the ruined wall until it was
quite dark. A voice of mirth and revelry sounded in the
front of that prison, whose gloomy walls and strong iron
barred windows might, and no doubt did, enclose hearts
more sorrowful than mine, but none more anxious. My situation,
solitary as it was, was full of peril&mdash;I might be missed
at the fte, and suspicion roused if I was so fortunate as to
succeed; but I allowed no selfish thought to intrude. I was
so fortunate as to find the low arched door I had heard my
father speak of; after considerable labour it yielded to my
efforts, and I entered the low and noisesome vault which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
heard and re-echoed the groans of so many victims of tyranny
whose only fault was adhering to the dictates of their consciences
against an intolerant priesthood. So baleful was the
air I breathed, that I was forced to retire, or I had fallen to
the damp floor; again I entered, for I heard the voice of
my lord in prayer, and felt a new sort of assurance arise
in my mind; there was no distinguishing one object from another,
so impenetrable was the darkness, and the faint sound
appeared to come from no particular side of the dungeon. I
commenced groping with my hands, from the entrance, along
the walls; it was a loathsome task, for they were damp and
ropy, and loathsome reptiles ever and anon made me withdraw
my fingers; still I groped on. At length I succeeded; the
door was forced to yield to my skill and efforts; all that divided
me from him I sought was the strong planks and plaster.
I struck a sharp single blow upon it, and paused&mdash;the voice
of my master had ceased from the commencement of my
work upon the second door. It was a period of intense
anxiety, lest he should alarm his guards, if any of them
had been in his dungeon. To my first signal no answer was
made: he knew not that he had a friend so near, willing
to sacrifice everything for his rescue. I struck a second
blow, and again listened; I heard him utter a faint exclamation
of surprise, and all was again still. The third time
I struck, and I heard a movement on the other side: the
plaster was struck, piercing a small hole, and we were enabled
to communicate. I found he was alone in his dismal
dungeon. It was agreed that I was to return in two hours
with a disguise for him, after I had appeared at the fte;
and, in the meantime, I loosened the fastening so as he
could easily force it away should any thing happen to prevent
my return; and, these arrangements being made, I
took my departure, in the same stealthy manner in which I
had reached him.</p>

<p>"With my heart still anxious but more at ease, I joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the festive throng, and, joining in the dance for a short time,
then retired, got all ready, returned, with a view to relieve
my lord from his dungeon, and had the unspeakable pleasure
to see him beyond its walls, dressed as a peasant girl. Our
parting was brief but sincere, my wishes for his safety were
equal to the extent of my love, but I have never heard of
him since; whether he went for La Vendee, or joined the
allied army, I never knew. As soon as I saw him safe out
of the town, I returned to the joyous group, and was among
the last to leave it. My share in the escape of my noble
master was never even suspected; but from this time I have
wished the fall of the tyrants that have ruled France with a
rod of iron, and for the return of our King and nobility,
until which time we can never hope for tranquillity. I am
not displeased at what can assist in aiding their overthrow
but I feel, as a true Frenchman, humbled at every defeat
our brave forces sustain. I love the beautiful fields of
France and all her sons, but I hate the demagogues who at
present rule her destinies."</p>

<p>Had I not been an exile against my will, I never had
been more happy in my life than I was at this time. I, no
doubt, was a prisoner of war; but it was only in name. I
never saw my prison but once a-week, when I appeared at
the muster to receive my jail allowance, and returned to
citizen Vauquin's in a few hours after, or strayed where I
chose within the proscribed distance. Our visits to the
prison always gave rise to an afternoon of merriment and
pleasure&mdash;a meeting of friends. Not one of us wished to
escape, or desired an exchange.</p>

<p>I was always a fortunate fellow. The four months I was
here I improved much in my drawing, and found the instructions
of poor Walden of the utmost service to me; and
I was much benefited by a relation of Vauquin's, who had
studied the arts at Paris. It was thus I spent my evenings;
but I was never as yet allowed to enjoy my good fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
long. We were ordered to be marched to the coast at
Saint Malos, where a cartel was to be in readiness to receive
us. I bade adieu to my kind friend, Citizen Vauquin, not
without regret, and set out for the coast. There was not a
trace of pleasure at our release among us; we had no cause,
at least nine-tenths of us. For, as Bill Wates had foretold,
off Jersey we were brought too by the <i>Ramillies</i>, and crowded
on board her. The greater part were draughted to other
men-of-war, but in her I remained until she was paid off,
at the peace.</p>

William Wastle, as he sat with a friend over a jug of reeking
toddy, in a tavern near the Bridge-end in Dumfries

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>o' waur looking women to be met wi' than my Kirsty; and
to say that her mither was a 'tinkler,' was very unjustifiable,
for her parents were as decent and respectable people,
in their sphere o' life, as ye would hae found in a' Nithsdale.
Her faither had a small farm which joined on with
one that I took a lease o', when I was about one-and-twenty.
Kirsty was about three years aulder; and, though not a
bonny woman, she was, in many respects, as ye shall hear
in the coorse o' my story, a very extraordinary one. I was
in the habit o' seeing her every day, and as I sometimes
was working in a field next to her, I had every opportunity
o' observing her industry, and that, frae mornin' till nicht,
she was aye eident. This gave me a far higher opinion o'
her than if I had seen her gaun about wi' a buskit head;
and often, at meal-times, I used to stand and speak to her
owre the dyke. But, after we had been acquainted in this
manner for some months, when the cheerfu' summer weather
came in, and the grass by the dyke-sides was warm and
green, and the bonny gowans blossomed among it, I louped
owre the dyke, and we sat doun and took our dinners together.
I couldna have believed it possible that a bit bare
bannock and a drap skim milk wad gang doun sae deliciously,
but never before had I partaken o' onything that
was sae pleasant to the palate. One day I was quite surprised,
when I found that my arm had slipped unconsciously
round her waist, and, drawing her closer to my side, I seighed,
and said&mdash;'O Kirsty, woman!'</p>

<p>"She pulled away my hand from her waist, and looking
me in the face, said&mdash;'Weel, Willie, man, what is't?'</p>

<p>"'Kirsty,' said I, 'I like ye.'"</p>

<p>"'I thocht as meikle,' quoth she, 'but could ye no hae
said sae at ance.'"</p>

<p>"'Perhaps I could, dear,' said I; 'but ye ken true love
is aye blate; however, if ye hae nae objections, I'll gang
yont, after fothering time the micht, and speak to yer faither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and mither; and if they hae nae objections, and ye have yer
providin' ready, wi' yer guid-will and consent, I shall gie
up oor names, and we shall be cried on Sabbath first.'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' said she, 'I haena lived for five-and-twenty years
without expectin' to get a guidman some day; and I hae
had my providin' ready since I was eighteen, an' a' o' my
ain spinnin' and bleachin', an' the lint bocht wi' what I had
wrocht for; so that I am behauden to naebody. My faither
and mither have mair sense than to cast ony obstacle in the
way o' my weelfare; and, as ye are far frae bein' disagreeable
to me, if we are to be married, it may as weel be sune
as syne, and we may be cried on Sunday if ye think proper.'</p>

<p>"'O Kirsty, woman!" cried I, and I drew my arm round
her waist again, 'ye hae made me as happy as a prince!
I hardly ken which end o' me is upmost!'</p>

<p>"'Na, Willie,' said she, 'there is nae necessity for ony
nonsensical raptures, ye ken perfectly weel that yer head
is upmost, though I hae heard my faither talk about some
idiots that he ca's philosophers, who say that the world
whirls roond aboot like a cart-wheel on an axle-tree, and that
ance in every twenty-four hours our feet are upmost, and our
head downmost; but it will be lang or onybody get me to believe
in sic balderdash! As to yer being happy at present, it
shall be nae faut o' mine if ye are not aye sae; and if ye be
aye as I would wish ye to be, ye will never be unhappy.'</p>

<p>"Such, as near as I can recollect, is not only the history,
but the exact words o' oor courtship. Her faither and
mither gied their consent without the slightest hesitation.
I remember her faither's words to me were&mdash;'Weel, William,
frae a' that I hae seen o' ye, ye appear to be a very
steady and industrious young man, and ane that is likely to
do weel in the world. I hae seen, also, wi' great satisfaction,
that ye are very regular in yer attendance upon the
ordinances; there hasna been a Sabbath, since ye cam to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
oor neebor, that I hae missed ye oot o' yer seat in the kirk.
Frae a' that I hae heard concernin' ye, also, ye hae always
been a serious, sober, and weel-behaved young man. These
things are a great satisfaction to a faither when he finds
them in the lad that his dochter wishes to marry. Ye hae
my consent to tak Kirsty; and, though I say it, I believe
ye will find her to mak as industrious, carefu', and kind a
wife, as ye would hae found if ye had sought through a'
broad Scotland for ane. I will say it, however, and before
her face, that there are some things in which she takes it o'
her mother, and in which she will hae her ain way. But
this is her only faut. I'm sure ye'll ne'er hae cause to complain
o' her wasting a bawbee, or o' her allowing even the
heel o' a kebbuck to gang to unuse. It is needless for me
to say mair; but ye hae my full and free consent to marry
when ye like.'</p>

<p>"Then up spoke the auld guidwife, and said&mdash;'Weel,
Willie, lad, if you and Kirsty hae made up yer minds
to mak a bargain o' it, I am as little disposed to oppose yer
inclinations as her faither is. A guid wife, I sincerely
believe, ye will find her prove to ye; and though her faither
says that in some things she will be like me, and have her
ain way, let me tell ye, lad, that is owre often necessary for
a woman to do, wha is striving everything in her power for
the guid o' her husband and the family, and sees him, just
through foolishness, as it were, striving against her. Ye are
strange beings you men-folk to deal wi'. But ye winna find
her a bare bride, for she has a kist fu' o' linen o' her ain
spinnin', that may serve ye a' yer days, and even when ye
are dead, though ye should live for sixty years.'</p>

<p>"I thought it rather untimeous that the auld woman
should hae spoken aboot linen for oor grave-claes, before
we were married; and I suppose my countenance had
hinted as much, for Kirsty seemed to hae observed it, and
she said&mdash;'My mother says what is and ought to be. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
aye best to be provided for whatever may come; and as
Death often gies nae warning, I wadna like to be met wi' it,
and to hae naething in the house to lay me out in like a
Christian.'</p>

<p>"I thought there was a vast deal o' sense and discretion
in what she said; and though I didna like the idea o' such
a premature providing o' winding-sheets, yet, after she
spoke, I highly approved o' her prudence and forethought.</p>

<p>"It was on a Monday afternoon, about three weeks after
the time I have been speaking o', that Kirsty, wi' her
faither, and mother, and another young lass, an acquaintance
o' hers, that was to be best-maid, cam yont to my
house for her and me to be married. I had sent for ane o'
my brothers to be best-man, and he was with me waiting
when they came. She was not in the least discomposed,
but behaved very modestly. In a few minutes the minister
arrived, when the ceremony immediately began, and within
a quarter of an hour she was mine, and I was hers, for the
term o' oor natural lives.</p>

<p>"From the time that I took the farm, I had no kind o'
dishes in the house, save a wooden bowie or twa, four
trenchers, three piggins, and twa bits o' tin cans, that I had
bought from a travelling tinker for twopence a-piece, and
which Kirsty afterwards told me, were each a halfpenny
a-piece aboon their value. I dinna think that I had tasted
tea aboon a dozen times in the whole course o' my life; but,
as it was coming into general use, I thought it would look
respectfu' to my bride, before her faither and mother, if I
should hae tea upon oor marriage day, and I could ask the
minister to stop and tak a dish wi' us. I thought it would
gie a character o' respectability to oor wedding. Therefore,
on the Saturday afore the marriage, I went to Dumfries, and
bought half a dozen o' bonny blue cups and saucers. I
never durst tell Kirsty how meikle I gied for them. It was
with great difficulty that I got them carried hame without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
breaking. I also bought two ounces o' the best tea, and a
whole pound o' brown sugar.</p>

<p>"I had a servant lassie at the time, the doohter o' a hind
in the neighbourhood; she was necessary to me to do the
work about the house, and to milk twa kye that I kept, to
mak the cheese, and a part o' the day to help the workers
out wi' the bondage.</p>

<p>"'Lassie,' said I, when I got hame; 'do ye ken hoo to
mak tea?'</p>

<p>"'I'm no very sure,' said she; 'but I think I do. I ance
got a cup when I wasna weel, frae the farmer's wife that my
faither lives wi'. I'll try.'</p>

<p>"'Here, then,' says I; 'tak care o' thir, and see that ye
dinna break them, or it will mak a breaking that ye
wouldna like in your quarter's wages.' So I gied her the
cups and saucers to put awa carefully into the press.</p>

<p>"'O maister,' says she; 'but noo, when I recollect, ye'll
need a tea-kettle, and a tea-pat, and a cream-pat, and teaspoons.'</p>

<p>"'Preserve me!' quoth I, 'the lassie is surely wrang in
the head! Hoo mony articles o' <i>tea</i> and <i>cream</i> hae ye there?
The parritch kettle will do as weel as a tea-kettle&mdash;where
can be the difference? Your tea-pats I ken naething aboot,
and as for a cream-pat, set down the cream-bowie; and as
for spoons, ye fool, they dinna sip tea&mdash;they drink it&mdash;just
sirple it, as it were, oot o' the saucer.'</p>

<p>"'O sir,' said she; 'but they need a little spoon to stir
it round to mak the sugar melt&mdash;and that is weel minded,
ye'll also require a sugar-basin.'</p>

<p>"'Hoots! toots! lassie,' cried I, 'do ye intend to ruin
me? By yer account o' the matter, it would be almost as
expensive to set up a tea equipage, as a chariot equipage.
No, no; just do as the miller's wife o' Newmills did.'</p>

<p>"'And what way micht that be, sir?' inquired she.</p>

<p>"'Why,' said I, 'she took such as she had, and she never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
wanted! Just ye tak such as ye have&mdash;cogie, bowie, or
tinniken, never ye mind&mdash;show ye your dexterity.'</p>

<p>"'Very weel, sir,' said she; 'I'll do the best I can.'</p>

<p>"But, just to exemplify another trait in my wife's character,
I will tell ye the upshot o' my cups and saucers. I
confess that I was in a state of very considerable perturbation;
not only on account o' what the lassie had told me
about the want o' a tea-kettle, tea-pat, and so forth, but
also that, including the minister, there were seven o' us,
while I had but six cups; and I consoled mysel by thinking
that, as Kirsty and I were now <i>one</i>, she might drink oot o'
the cup and I wad tak the saucer, so that a cup and saucer
would serve us baith; and I was trustin to the ingenuity o'
the lassie to find substitutes for the other deficiencies,
when she came ben to where we were sitting, and going
forward to Kirsty, says she&mdash;'Mistress, I have had the
twa ounces o' tea on boiling in a chappin o' water, for
the last twa hoors&mdash;do ye think it will be what is ca'ed
<i>masked</i> noo?'</p>

<p>"'Tea!' said my new-made wife, wi' a look o' astonishment;
'is the lassie talking aboot <i>tea</i>? While I am to be
in this house&mdash;and I suppose that is to be for my life&mdash;there
shall nae poisonous foreign weed be used in it, nor
come within the door, unless it be some drug that a doctor
orders. Take it off the fire, and throw the broo awa. My
certes! if young folk like us were to begin wi' sic extravagance,
where would be the upshot? Na, na, Willie,' said
she, turning round to me, 'let us just begin precisely as we
mean to end. At all events, let us rather begin meanly,
than end beggarly. I hae seen some folk, no aboon oor
condition in life, mak a great dash on their wedding-day;
and some o' them even hire gigs and coaches, forsooth, to
tak a jaunt awa for a dozen o' miles! Poor things! it was
the first and last time that ony o' them was either in gig or
coach. But there shall be nae extravagance o' that kind for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
me. My faither and mither care naething about tea, for they
hae never been used to it, and I'm sure that our friends here
care as little; and, asking the minister's pardon, I am perfectly
sure and certain, that tea can be nae treat to him, for
he has it every day, and it will be standing ready for him
when he gangs hame. The supper will be ready by eight
o'clock, and those who wish it, may tak a glass o' speerits
in the meantime&mdash;as it isna every day that they are at my
wedding.'</p>

<p>"Her faither and mother looked remarkable proud and
weel-pleased like at what she said, just as if they wished to
say to me&mdash;'There's a wife for ye!' But I thought the
minister seemed a good deal surprised, and in a few minutes
he took up his hat, wished us much joy, and went away.
For my part, I didna think sae much aboot my bride's lecture,
as I rejoiced that she thereby released me from the
confusion I should have experienced in exposing the poverty
o' my tea equipage.</p>

<p>"It was on the very morning after oor marriage, and
just as I was gaun oot to my wark&mdash;'Willie,' says she, 'I
think we should single the turnips in the field west o' the
hoose the day. The cotters' twa bondage lasses, and me,
will be able to manage it by the morn's nicht.'</p>

<p>"'O, my dear,' quoth I, 'but I hae nae intention that ye
should gang out into the fields to work, noo that ye are my
wife. Let the servant-lass gang out, and ye can look after
the meat.'</p>

<p>"'Her! the idle taupie!' said she, 'we hae nae mair need
for her than a cart has for a third wheel. Mony a time it
has grieved me to observe her motions, when ye were out o'
the way&mdash;and there would she and the other twa wenches
been standing, clashing for an hour at a time, and no
workin' a stroke. I often had it in my mind to tell ye, but
only I thought ye might think it forward in me, as I perceived
ye had a kindness for me. But I can baith do all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
that is to do in-doors, and work out-by also, and at the end
o' the quarter she shall leave.'</p>

<p>"'Wi' a' my heart,' says I, 'if ye wish it;' for it struck
me she micht be a wee thocht jealous o' the lassie; 'but
there is no the sma'est necessity for you working out in the
fields; for though she leaves, we can get a callant at threepence
a-day, that would just do as muckle out-work as she
does, and ye would hae naething to attend to but the affairs
o' the hoose.'</p>

<p>"'O William!' replied she, 'I'm surprised to hear ye
speak. Ye talk o' threepence a-day just as if it were naething.
Hoo mony starving families are there, that threepence
a-day would mak happy? It is my maxim never to
spend a penny unless it be laid out to the greatest possible
advantage. Ye should always keep that in view, every
time ye put yer hand in your pocket. He that saves a
penny has as mony thanks, in the lang run, as he that gies
it awa. Threepence a-day, not including the Sabbath, is
eighteenpence a-week; noo, you that are a scholar, only
think how much that comes to in a twelvemonth. There
are fifty-twa weeks in the year&mdash;that is fifty-twa shillings;
and fifty-twa sixpences is&mdash;how much?'</p>

<p>"'Twenty-six shillings, my dear,' said I, for I was quite
amused at her calculation&mdash;the thing had never struck me
before.</p>

<p>"'Weel,' added she, 'fifty-two shillings and twenty-six
shillings, put that together, and see how much it comes to.'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' says I, after half a minute's calculation, 'it will
just be three pounds, eighteen shillings, to a farthing.'</p>

<p>"'Noo,' cried she, 'only think o' that!&mdash;three pounds
eighteen shillings a-year; and ye would throw it away, just
as if it were three puffs o' breath! Now, William, just
listen to me and tak tent&mdash;that is within twa shillings o'
four pounds. It would far mair than cleed you and me,
out and out, frae head to foot, from year's end to year's end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
But at present the wench's meat and wages come to three
times that, and therefore I am resolved, William, that while
I am able to work, we shall neither throw away the one
nor the other. It is best that we should understand each
other in time: therefore, I just tell ye plainly, as I said
yesterday, that as I wish to end, I mean to begin. This
very day, this very morning and hour, I go out wi' the
bondage lassies to single the turnips; and, at the end o' the
quarter, the lazy taupie butt-a-house maun walk aboot her
business.'</p>

<p>"'Weel, Kirsty, my darling,' says I, 'your way be it.
Only I maun again say, that I had no wish or inclination
whatever to see you toiling and thinning turnips beneath a
burning sun, or maybe taking them up and shawing them,
when the cauld drift was cutting owre the face keener than
a razor.'</p>

<p>"'Weel, William,' quoth she, 'it is needless saying any
more words about it&mdash;it is my fixed and determined resolution.'</p>

<p>"'Then, hinny,' says I, 'if ye be absolutely resolved upon
that, it is o' no manner o' use to say ony mair upon the
subject, of course&mdash;your way be it.'</p>

<p>"So the servant lassie was discharged accordingly, and
Kirsty did everything hersel. Wet day and dry day, whatever
kind o' wark was to be done, there was she in the
middle o' it, by her example spurring on the bondagers.
Even when we began to hae a family, I hae seen her working
in the fields wi' an infant on her back; and I am certain
that for a dozen o' harvests, while she was aye at the head
o' the shearers, there was aye our bairn that was youngest
at the time, lying rowed up in a blanket at the foot o' the
rig, and playing wi' the stubble to amuse itsel.</p>

<p>"There were many that said that I was entirely under
her thumb, and that she had the maister-skep owre me.
But that was a grand mistake, for she by no means exercised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
onything like maistership owre me; though I am free to
confess, that I at all times paid a great degree o' deference
to her opinions, and that she had a very particular and
powerfu' way o' enforcing them. Yet, although I was in
no way cowed by her, there wasna a bairn that we had, from
the auldest to the youngest, that durst play <i>cheep</i> before her.
She certainly had her family under great subjection, and
their bringing up did her great credit. They were allowed
time to play like ither bairns&mdash;but from the time that they
were able to make use o' their hands, ye would hardly hae
found it possible to come in upon us, and seen ane o' them
idle. All were busy wi' something; and no ane o' them
durst hae stepped owre a prin lying on the floor, without
stooping doun to tak it up, or passed onything that was out
o' its place without putting it right. For I will say for her
again, that, if my Kirsty wasna a bonny wife, she was not
only a thrifty but a tidy ane, and keepit every ane and every
thing tidy around her.</p>

<p>"She was a strange woman for abhorring everything that
was new-fangled. She was a most devout believer in, and
worshipper o' the wisdom o' oor ancestors. She perfectly
hated everything like change; and as to onything that implied
speculation, ye micht as weel hae spoken o' profanation
in her presence. She said she liked auld friends, auld customs,
auld fashions; and was the sworn enemy o' a' the innovations
on the practices and habits that had been handed
doun frae generation to generation. I dinna ken if ever
she heard the names Whig or Tory in her life; but if Tory
mean an enemy o' change, then my Kirsty certainly was a
Tory o' the very purest water.</p>

<p>"I dinna suppose that she believed there was such a word
as <i>improvement</i> in the whole Dictionary. She would hae
allooed everything to stand steadfast as Lot's wife, for ever
and for ever. But, however, just to gie ye a specimen or
twa o' her remarkable disposition:&mdash;I think it was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
sixteen years after we were married, that I took a tack o' an
adjoining farm, which was much larger than the ane we occupied.
I was conscious it would require every penny we
had scraped thegither, and that we had saved, to stock it.
My wife was by no means favourable to my taking it. She
said we kenned what we had done, but we didna ken what
we might do; and it was better to go on as we were doing,
than to risk oor a'. I acknowledge that there was a vast
deal o' truth in what she said; but, however, I saw that the
farm was an excellent bargain, and I was resolved to tak
it, say what she might; and therefore, though she was said
to domineer owre me, yet, just to prove to every person round
about that I was not under a wife's government, I did tak
it. I had not had it twa years, when I began to find that
thrashing wi' the flail would never answer. Often, when the
markets were on the rise, and when I could hae turned owre
many pounds into my ain pocket, I found it was a'thegither
impossible for me to get my corn thrashed in time to catch
the markets while they were high; and I am certain that,
in the second year that I had the new farm, I lost at least a
hundred pounds frae that cause alone&mdash;that is, I didna get
a hundred pounds that I micht hae got, and that was much
the same as losing it oot o' my pocket. Thrashing machines
at that period were just beginning to come into vogue, but
there was a terrible outcry against them; and mony a ane
said that they were an invention o' the Prince o' Darkness;
for my part I wish he would never do mair ill upon the
earth, than invent sic things as thrashing-machines. Hooever,
I saw plain and clearly the advantage that the machine
had owre the flail, and I was determined to hae ane. But
never did I see a woman in such a steer as the mention o'
the thing put Kirsty in! She went perfectly wild aboot it.</p>

<p>"'What, William!' she cried, 'what do ye talk aboot?
Losh me, man, have ye nae mair sense?&mdash;have ye nae discretion
whatever? Will ye really rush upon ruin at a horse-race?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Ye talk aboot getting a machine! How, I ask ye,
how do ye expect that ever ye could prosper for a single day
after, if ye were to throw oor twa decent barn-men oot o'
employment, and their families oot o' bread? I just ask
ye that question, William. Does na the proverb say&mdash;'Live
and let live;' and hoo are men to live, if, by an invention
o' the Enemy o' mankind, ye tak work oot o' their hands,
and bread oot o' their mouths?'</p>

<p>"'Dear me, Kirsty!' said I, 'hoo is it possible that a
woman o' your excellent sense can talk such nonsense? Ye
see very weel that, if I had had a machine, I micht hae
made a hundred pounds mair than I did by last year's crops&mdash;that,
certainly, would hae been a good turn to us&mdash;and,
tak my word for it, it is neither in the power nor in the
nature o' the Evil One to do a guid turn to onybody.'</p>

<p>"'Willie,' quoth she, 'ye talk like a silly man&mdash;like a
very silly man, indeed. If the Enemy o' mankind hadna
it in his power to do for us what we tak to be for oor guid,
hoo in the warld do ye think he could tempt us to our hurt?
I say, that thrashing-machines are an invention o' his, and
that they are ane o' the instruments he is bringing up for
the ruin o' this country. It is him, and him alone, that is
putting it into your head to buy ane o' his infernal devices,
in order that he may not only ruin you, baith soul and body,
by filling ye wi' a desire o' riches, an' making ye the oppressor
and the robber o' the poor, but that, through your
oppression and robbery, he may ruin them also, and bring
them to shame or the gallows!'</p>

<p>"'Forgie me, Kirsty,' said I, 'what in a' the world do ye
mean? Hoo is it possible that ye can talk aboot me as
likely to be either an oppressor or a robber o' the poor?
I'll declare there never was a beggar passed either me or
my door, that ever I saw, but I gied him something. I'm
sure, guidwife, ye baith ken better o' me, and think better
o' me than to talk sae.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Yes, William,' said she, 'I did think better o' ye; but
I noo see distinctly that the Enemy is leading ye blindfolded
to your ruin. First, through the pride o' your heart, he
tempted ye to tak this big farm, that, as ye thocht, ye
might hasten to be rich; and now he is seducing ye to buy
ane o' his diabolical machines for the same end, and in order
that ye may not only deprive honest men and their families
o' bread, but, belike, rather than starve, tempt them to steal!
And what ca' ye that but oppressing and robbing the poor?
Hooever, buy a machine!&mdash;buy ane, and ye'll see what will
be the upshot! If ye dinna repent it, say I'm no your wife.'</p>

<p>"I confess her words were onything but agreeable to me,
and they rather set me a hesitating hoo to act. Hooever
my mind was bent upon buying the machine. I had said
to several o' my neebors that I intended to hae ane put up;
and I was convinced that, if I drew back o' my word, it
would be said that my wife wouldna let me get it, and I
would be made a general laughing-stock&mdash;and that was a
thing that I held in greater dread than even my wife's lectures,
severe as they sometimes were; therefore, reason or
nane, I got a machine put up. It caused a very general
outcry amongst a' the 'datal' men and their wives for miles
round. At ae time I even thocht that they would mob
me and pull it to pieces. But all their clamour was a mere
snaw-flake fa'ing in the sea, compared wi' the perpetual
dirdum that Kirsty rang in my ears about it. She actually
threatened that judgments would follow, and I didna ken a'
what. But, on the morning o' the day that I yoked the
horses into it, and began to thrash wi' it for the first time
I declare to you that she took the six bairns wi' her, and
absolutely went to her faither's, vowing to work for them
until the blood sprang from her finger-ends, rather then live
wi' a man that would be guilty o' such madness and iniquity.</p>

<p>"But having heard before dinner-time that I had had to
employ a woman at sixpence a-day to feed into the machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
she came back as fast as her feet could carry her, wi' a' the
bairns behint her, and ordering the stranger away, began to
feed the machine hersel', and the bairns carried her the sheaves.</p>

<p>"I saw that out o' a spirit o' pure wickedness, she was
distressing hersel' far beyond what there was the sma'est
occasion for. It was as clear as day, that indignation was
working in her heart, like barm fermenting in a bottle, and
just about half an hour before we were to leave off thrashing
for the nicht, she was seized with a very alarming pain
in the breast. I saw and said it was a hysterical affection,
and was altogether the consequence o' the passion that she
had given way to on account o' the unlucky machine. She,
however, denied that there were such diseases in existence
as either hysterical or nervous affections. They were sham
disorders, she said, that cam into the country wi' tea and
spirit-drinking; and she assuredly was free from indulging
in either the ane or the other. But she grew worse and
worse, and was at last obliged to sit down upon some straw
on the barn-floor. I ventured forward to her, and said&mdash;'Kirsty,
woman, ye had better gang awa into the house.
Ye will do yersel' mair ill by sittin there, for there is a current
o' air through the loft, which, after you being warm
with working, may gie ye your death o' cauld. Rise up,
dear, and gang awa into the house, and try if a glass o'
usquebae will do ye ony guid.'</p>

<p>"Maister Burns, the poet, has said&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="padding-left:30%">'She has an ee, she has but <i>ane</i>;'<br /></span></p>


<p>but, certes, had he seen the look that she gied me as I then
spoke to her, he would hae been satisfied that she had <i>twa</i>!
I saw it was o' nae manner o' use for me either to offer
advice or to express sympathy. The wife o' an auld man
that was called John Neilson, and who for several years had
been our barn-man, came into the machine-loft at the time,
and wi' a great deal o' concern she asked my wife what was
like the matter wi' her. Now this auld Peggy Neilson had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the reputation, for miles round, o' being an extraordinary
<i>skilly</i> woman. There wasna a bairn in the parish took a
sair throat, or got a burnt foot, or a cut finger, or took a
<i>dwam</i> for a day or twa, but its mother said&mdash;'I maun hae
Peggy Neilson spoken to aboot that bairn, before it be owre
late.' Kirsty, therefore, told her hoo she was affected, when
the other, wi' the confidence o' a doctor o' medicine brought
up at the first college in the kingdom, said&mdash;'Then, ma'am,
if that be the way ye feel, there is naething in the warld sae
guid for ye as a blast o' the pipe. I aye carry a tinder-box
and flint and steel wi' me, and ye are welcome to a whuff o'
my cutty.'</p>

<p>"Now, Kirsty was a bitter enemy to baith smoking and
snuffing in general; but she had great faith in the skill o'
Peggy Neilson, and wad far rather hae done whatever she
advised than followed the prescription o' the best doctor in
a' the land. She took the auld woman's pipe, therefore,
and began to blaw through a spirit o' pain and perverseness
at the same moment. As I anticipated, it soon made her
dizzy in the head, and she had to be led to the house.
Hooever, in a short time, the pain she had been suffering
was greatly abated, though whether the smoking contributed
towards removing it or not, I dinna pretend to say. Just
as she had been taen to the house, we were dune wi'
thrashing for the day, and I was very highly gratified wi'
the day's wark.</p>

<p>"But I was very tired, and as soon as I had had my
sowens I went to bed. I several times thought, and remarked
it, that there was a sort o' burnt smell about.</p>

<p>"'Ay,' said Kirsty, who by this time was a great deal
better; 'they who will use the engines o' forbidden agents
maun expect to smell them, as in the end they will feel
them.'</p>

<p>"Being conscious it was o' nae use to reason wi' her, for
she in general had the better o' me in an argument, I tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to compose mysel' to sleep. But it was in vain to think o'
closing my een, for the smell o' burning grew stronger and
stronger, and I was rising again, saying&mdash;'There is something
burning aboot somewhere, and I canna rest until I
hae seen what it is.'</p>

<p>"'Nor let other folk rest either,' said Kirsty.</p>

<p>"Just at that moment, oor eldest dochter, who was as
perfect a picture o' beauty as ever man looked upon wi' eyes
o' admiration, and who being alarmed by the smell, as well
as me, had gane oot to examine from what it proceeded
came running oot o' breath, crying&mdash;'Faither! faither!-the
barn and everything is on fire!'</p>

<p>"'O goodness!' cried I, as I threw on part o' my claes
in the twinkling o' an ee; 'what wretch can hae been sae
wicked as to do it!'</p>

<p>"'It's a judgment upon ye,' said Kirsty, 'for having
such a thing about the place, after a' the admonitions ye
had against it. I said ye would see what would be the upshot,
and it hasna been lang o' coming.'</p>

<p>"'O ye tormenter o' my life!' cried I, as I ran oot o' the
house; 'it's your handy-work!'</p>

<p>"'Mine!' exclaimed she. 'O ye heartless man that ye
are, how dare ye presume either to say or think sic a thing!'
and she followed me out.</p>

<p>"The whole stackyard was black wi' smoke&mdash;it was hardly
possible to breathe&mdash;and a great sheet o' fire, like the mouth
o' a fiery dragon, was rushing and roaring out at the barn-door.
I didna ken what to do; I was ready to rush head
foremost into the middle o' the flames, as if that I could hae
crushed them out wi' the weight o' my body; and I am persuaded
that I would hae darted right into the machine loft,
where the flames were bursting through the very tiles, as
frae the mouth o' a volcano, had not my wife, and our eldest
daughter Janet, flewn after me and held me in their arms,
the one crying&mdash;'Be calm, William&mdash;do naething rashly&mdash;let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
us see to save what can be saved;' and the other saying&mdash;'Faither!
faither! dinna risk your life.'</p>

<p>"Now, there was a hard frost owre the entire face o' the
ground, and there wasna a drop o' water to be got within a
quarter o' a mile; and the whole o' my year's crop, with, the
exception o' what had that day been thrashed, was in the
stackyard. I shouted at the pitch of my voice for assistance,
but the devouring flames soon roared louder than I did.
Kirsty, wi' her usual presence o' mind, began to clear away
the straw from around the barn, to prevent the fire from
spreading, and she called upon the bairns and me to follow
her example. She also ordered a laddie to set the horses out
o' the stables, and the nowt oot o' the 'courtine,' and drive
them into a field, where they would be oot o' danger. A'
our neighbours round aboot, in a short time arrived to our
assistance; but a' our combined efforts were unavailing.
The wood wark o' the machine was already on fire&mdash;the barn
roof fell in, and up flew such a volley o' smoke and firmament
o' fire as man had never witnessed. The sparks ascended in
millions upon millions; and as they poured down again
like a shower o' fire, every stack that I had broke into a
blaze, and the whole produce o' my farm, corn, straw, and hay
became as a burning fiery furnace. It became impossible
for ony living thing to remain in the stackyard. From
end to end, and round and round, it was one fierce and awful
flame. The heat was scorching, and the dense smoke was
baith blinding and suffocating. Every person was obliged
to flee from it. The very cattle in the field ran about in
confusion, and moaned wi' terror, and the horses neighed wi'
fright, and pranced to and fro. I stood at a distance, as
motionless as a dead man, gazing wi' horror upon the terrific
scene o' desolation, beholding the destruction o' my property&mdash;the
burning up, as I may say, o' a' my prospects.
The teeth in my head chattered thegither, and every joint in
my body seemed oot o' its socket; and the raging o' destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in the stackyard was naething to the raging o' misery
in my breast; and especially because I coudna banish frae
my brain the awfu' thought that the hand o' the wife o' my
bosom had lighted the conflagration. While I was standing
in this state o' speechless agony, and some around about me
were pitying me, while others in whispers said&mdash;'He had
nae business to get a thrashing machine, and the thing woudna
hae happened,' Kirsty came forward to me, and takin' me
by the hand, said&mdash;'William, dinna be silly&mdash;appear like a
man before folk. Our loss is nae doubt great, but in time
we may get ower it; and be thankfu' that it is nae waur
than it is like to be&mdash;for your wife and bairns are spared to
ye, and we have escaped unskaithed.'</p>

<p>"'Awa, ye descendant o' Judas Iscariot!' cried I; 'dinna
speak to me!'</p>

<p>"'William,' said she, calmly, 'what infatuation possesses
ye, man?&mdash;dinna mak a fool o' yoursel'.'</p>

<p>"'Awa wi' ye!' cried I, perfectly shaking wi' rage.</p>

<p>"'Dear me!' I heard a neighbour remark to another;
'how gruffly he speaks to Kirsty! I aye thought that she
had the upperhand o' him, but it doesna appear by his manner
o' speaking to her.'</p>

<p>"Distracted, wretched, and angry as I was, I experienced
a sort o' secret pleasure at hearing the observation. I had
shewn them that I wasna a slave tied to my wife's apron-strings,
as they supposed me to be. Kirsty left me wi' a
look that had baith scorn and pity in it. But oor auldest
lassie, my bonny fair-haired Janet&mdash;to look upon whose
face I always delighted beyond everything on earth&mdash;came
running forward to me; and throwing her arms about my neck,
sobbed wi' her face upon my breast, and softly whispered&mdash;'Dinna
stand that way, faither, a' body is looking at ye; and
dinna speak harshly to my poor mother&mdash;she is distressed
enough without you being angry wi' her.' I bent my head
upon my bairn's shouther, and the tears ran doun my cheeks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"By this time, everything was oot o' the house; and the
fire was prevented from reaching it, chiefly through the
daring exertions o' a hafflins laddie, whose name was James
Patrick, who was the son o' a neebor farmer, and who,
though no aboon seventeen years o' age, I observed was very
fond o' oor bonny Janet; for I had often observed the young
creatures wandering in the loaning thegither; and when ye
mentioned the name o' the ane before the other, the blood
rose to their face.</p>

<p>"Next morning, the stackyard, barn, byres, and stables,
presented a fearful picture o' devastation. There was naething
to be seen but the still smoking heaps o' burnt straw
and roofless buildings, wi' wreck and ruin to the richt hand
and to the left. Some thought that the calamity would
knock me aff my feet, and cause me to become a broken
man&mdash;and I thought myself that that would be its effect.
But Kirsty was determined that we should never sink while
we had a finger to wag to keep us aboon the water. Cheap
as she had always maintained the house, she now keepit it
at almost no expense whatever. For more than two years,
nothing was allowed to come into it but what the farm produced,
and what we had within ourselves, neither in meat
nor in claething.</p>

<p>"But though I witnessed all her exertions, nothing
could satisfy my mind that she was not the cause o' the
destruction o' the machine, and through it o' all that was
in and about the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'stack-yard'">stackyard</ins>. The idea haunted me perpetually,
and rendered me miserable, and I could not look
upon my wife without saving to mysel&mdash;'Is it possible that
she could hae been guilty o' such folly and great wickedness.'
I was the more confirmed in my suspicion, because
she never again mentioned the subject o' the machine in
my hearing, neither would she allow it to be spoken aboot
by ony ane else.</p>

<p>"What gratified me maist, during the years that we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to undergo privation, was the cheerfulness wi' which all the
bairns submitted to it; and I couldna deny that it was
solely to her excellent manner o' bringing them up. Our
Janet, who was approaching what may be called womanhood,
was now talked o' through the hale country-side for
her beauty and sweet temper; and it pleased me to observe,
that, during our misfortune, the attentions o' James Patrick
(through whose skilful exertions oor house was saved frae
the conflagration) increased. It was admitted, on all hands,
that a more winsome couple were never seen in Nithsdale.</p>

<p>"Oor auldest son, David, who was only fifteen months
younger than his sister, had also grown to be o' great assistance
to me. Before he was seventeen he was capable o'
man's work, which enabled me to do with a hind less than
I had formerly employed. My landlord, also, was very
considerate; and, the first year after the burning, he gave
me back the half o' the rent, which I, with great difficulty,
had been able to scrape thegether. But when I went hame,
and, in the gladness o' my heart, began to count down the
money upon the table before Kirsty and the bairns, and to
tell them how good the laird had been&mdash;'Tak it up, William!'
cried she, 'tak it up, and gang back wi' it&mdash;he would
consider it an obligation a' the days o' our lives. I will be
beholden to neither laird nor lord! nor shall ony ane belonging
to me&mdash;sae, tak back the money, for it isna
ours!'</p>

<p>"'Bless me!' thought I, 'but this is something very remarkable.
This is certainly another proof that she really
is at the bottom o' the fire-raising. It is the consciousness
o' her guilt that makes her shudder at and refuse the kind kindness
o' the laird.'</p>

<p>"'It is braw talking, Kirsty,' said I, 'but I see nae
necessity for persons that hae been visited wi' a misfortune
such as we met wi', and wha hae suffered sae much on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
account o' it, to let their pride do them an injury or exceed
their discretion. Consider that we hae a rising family to
provide for.'</p>

<p>"'Consider what ye like,' quoth she, 'but, if ye accept
the siller, consider what will be the upshot. Ye would hae
to be hat in hand to him at all times and on all occasions.
Yer very bairns would be, as it were, his bought slaves.
No, William, tak back the money&mdash;I order ye!'</p>

<p>"'Ye <i>order</i> me!' cried I, 'there's a guid ane!&mdash;and where
got ye authority to order me. If ye will hae the siller taen
back, tak it back yersel.'</p>

<p>"Without saying another word, she absolutely whipped
it off the table, every plack and bawbee, into her apron;
and, throwing on her rockelay and hood, set aff to the laird's
wi' it, where, as I was afterwards given to understand, she
threw it down upon his table wi' as little ceremony as she
had sweept it aft' mine.</p>

<p>"Ye may weel imagine that baith my astonishment
and vexation were very considerable. I had seen a good
deal o' Kirsty, but the act o' taking back the siller
crowned a'!</p>

<p>"'Losh!' said I, in the pure bitterness o' my spirit, 'that
caps a'!&mdash;that is even worse than destroying the machine,
wi' the stacks and stabling into the bargain!'</p>

<p>"'What do ye mean about destroying the machine,
faither?' inquired Janet and David, almost at the same
instant&mdash;'who do ye say destroyed it?'</p>

<p>"'Naebody,' said I, angrily, 'naebody!'&mdash;for I found I
had said what I ought not to hae said.</p>

<p>"'Really, faither,' said Janet, 'whatever it may be that
ye think and hint at, I am certain that ye do my mother a
great injustice if ye harbour a single thought to her prejudice.
It may appear rather proud-spirited her takin back
the siller, though I hae na doubt, in the lang run, but we'll
a' approve o' it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>'</p>

<p>"'That is exactly what I think, too,' said David.</p>

<p>"'Oh, nae dout!' said I, 'nae dout o' that!&mdash;for she
has ye sae learned, that everything she does, or that ony o'
ye does, is always right; and whatever I do must be
wrang!' and I went oot o' the house in a pet, driving the
door behind me, and thinking about the machine and the
loss o' the siller.</p>

<p>"Hooever, I am happy to say, that although Kirsty did
tak back the money to the laird and leave it wi' him, yet,
as I have already hinted to ye, through her frugal management,
within a few years we got the better o' the burning.
But there is a saying, that some folk are no sooner weel
than they're ill again&mdash;and I'm sure I may say that at that
time. I no sooner got the better o' the effects o' ae calamity,
until another overtook me. Ye hae heard what a
terrible dirdum the erecting o' toll-bars caused throughout
the country, and upon the Borders in particular. Kirsty
was one o' those who cried oot most bitterly against them.
She threatened, that if it were attempted to place ane within
ten miles o' oor farm, she would tear it to pieces with her
ain hands.</p>

<p>"'Here's a bonny time o' day, indeed!' said she, 'that a
body canna gang for a cart-load o' coals or peats, or tak their
corn, or whatever it may be, to the market, but they must
pay whatever a set o' Justices o' the Peace please to charge
them for the liberty o' driving along the road. Na, na!
the roads did for our faithers before us, and they will do for
us. They went alang them free and without payment, and
so will we; for I defy any man to claim, what has been a
public road for ages, as his property. Only submit to such
an imposition, and see what will be the upshot. But, rather
than they shall mak sic things in this neighbourhood, I will
raise the whole countryside.'</p>

<p>"Unfortunately in this, as in everything else, she verified
her words. A toll-bar was erected within half-a-mile o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
oor door Kirsty was clean mad about it. She threatened
not only to break the yett to pieces, but to hang
the toll-keeper owre the yett-post if he offered resistance.
I thought o' my machine, and said little; and the more
especially because every ane, baith auld and young, and
through the whole country, so far as I could hear, were
o' the same sentiments as Kirsty. There never was onything
proposed in this kingdom that was mair unpopular.
And, I am free to confess, that, with regard to the injustice
o' toll-bars, I was precisely o' the same way o' thinkin' as
my wife&mdash;only I by no means wished to carry things to the
extremes that she wished to bring them to.</p>

<p>"I ought to tell ye, that our laird was more than suspected
o' being the principal cause o' us having a toll-bar
placed so near us, so that we could neither go to lime, coals,
nor market, without gaun through it. I was, therefore,
almost glad that my wife had taken back the siller to him,
lest&mdash;as I was against raising a disturbance about the
matter&mdash;folk should say that my hands and tongue were
tied wi' the siller which he had given me back; for, if I
didna wish to be considered the slave o' my wife, as little
did I desire to be thought the tool o' my landlord. But, ae
day, I had been in at Dumfries in the month o' July, selling
my wool; I had met wi' an excellent market, and a
wool-buyer from Leeds and I got very hearty thegether. He
had bought from me before; and, on that day, he bought
all that I had. I knew him to be an excellent man, though
a keen Yorkshireman&mdash;and, ye ken, that the Yorkshire folk
and we Scotchmen are a gay tight match for ane anither&mdash;though
I believe, after a', they rather beat us at keeping
the grip o' the siller; but as I intended to say, I treated
him, and he treated me, and a very agreeable day we had.
I recollect when he was pressing me to hae the other gill,
I sang him a bit hamely sang o' my ain composing. Ye
shall hear it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>However, I declare to you, it was very near ten o'clock
before I left the house we are sitting in at present, and put
my foot in the stirrup. But, as my friend Robin says&mdash;</p>


<p><span style="padding-left:25%">'Weel mounted on my grey mare Meg,'<br /></span></p>


<p>I feared for naething; and, though I had sixteen lang Scots

again&mdash;</p>

<div style="padding-left:25%">
'Kings may be great, but I was glorious,<br />
Owre a' the ills o' life victorious!'<br />
</div>

<p>But, just as I had reached within about half a mile o' the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
toll-bar that had been erected near my farm, I saw a sort o'
light rising frae the ground, and reflected on the sky. My
heart sank within me in an instant. I remembered the
last time I had seen such a light. I thought o' my burning
stackyard, o' my ruined machine, and o' Kirsty! My first
impulse was to gallop forward, but a thousand thoughts, a
thousand fears cam owre me in an instant; and I thought
that evil tidings come quick enough o' their ain accord,
without galloping to meet them. As I approached the toll-bar,
the flame and the reflection grew brighter and brighter;
and I heard the sound o' human voices, in loud and discordant
clamour. My forebodings told me, to use Kirsty's
words, what would be the upshot. I hadna reached
within a hundred yards o' the bar, when, aboon a' the
shouting and the uproar, I heard her voice, the voice o' my
ain wife, crying&mdash;'Mak him promise that it shall ne'er be
put up again&mdash;mak him swear to it&mdash;or let his yett gang
the gaet o' the toll-yett!'</p>

<p>"In a moment all that I had dreaded I found to be
true. At the sound o' her voice, hounding on the enraged
multitude, (though I didna altogether disapprove o' what
they were doing,) I plunged my spurs into my horse, and
galloped into the middle o' the outrageous crowd, crying&mdash;'Kirsty!
I say, Kirsty! awa hame wi' ye! What right or
what authority had ye to be there?'</p>

<p>"'Hear him! hear him!' cried the crowd, 'Willie has
turned a toll-bar man, and a laird man, because the Laird
once offered him the half o' his rent back again! Never
mind him, Kirsty!&mdash;we'll stand yer friends!'</p>

<p>"'I thank ye, neighbours,' said she, 'but I require nae
body to stand as friends between my guidman and me.
I ken it is my duty to obey him, that is, when he is
himsel', and comes hame at a reasonable time o' nicht; but
not when he is in a way that he doesna ken what he's
saying, as he is the nicht.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Weel done, Mistress Wastle!' cried a dozen o' them;
'we see ye hae the whip-hand o' him yet!'</p>

<p>"'The mischief tak ye!' cried I, 'for a wheen ill-mannered
scoundrels; but I'll let every mother's son and
dochter among ye ken whase hand the whip is in!'</p>

<p>"And, wi' that, I began to lay about me on every side;
but, before I had brought the whip half-a-dozen o' times
round my head, I found that the horse was out from under
me; and there was I wi' my back upon the ground, while,
on the one side, was a heavy foot upon my breast, and, on
the other, Kirsty threatening ony ane that would injure a
hair o' her husband's head; and my son David and James
Patrick rushing forward, seized the man by the throat that
had his foot upon my breast, and, in an instant, they had him
lying where I had lain; for they were stout, powerfu' lads.</p>

<p>"But when I got upon my feet, and began to recover from
the surprise that I had met wi', there did I see the laird
himsel, standing trembling like an ash leaf in the middle o'
the unruly mob&mdash;and, as ringleader o' the whole, my wife
Kirsty shaking her hand in his face, and endeavouring to
extort from him a promise, that there never should be another
toll-bar erected upon his grounds, while he was laird!</p>

<p>"'Kirsty!'I exclaimed, 'what are ye after? Are ye mad?'</p>

<p>"'No, William!' cried she, ' I am not mad, but I am
standing out for our rights against injustice; and sorry am
I to perceive that, at a time when everybody is crying out
and raising their hand against the oppression that is attempted
to be practised upon them, my guidman should be
the only coward in the countryside.'</p>

<p>"'William Wastle!' said the terrified laird, whom some
o' them were handling very roughly, (and principally, I must
confess, at the instigation o' Kirsty,) 'I am glad to see that
I have one tenant upon my estate who is a true man; and
I ask your protection.'</p>

<p>"'Such protection as I can afford, sir,' said I, 'ye shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
have; but, after the rough handling winch I have experienced
this very moment, I dout it is not much that is in
my power to afford ye.'</p>

<p>"'Get yer faither awa to his bed, bairns!' cried my wife,
as I was driving my way through the crowd to the assistance
o' the laird; and I'll declare, if my son David, and
James Patrick, didna actually come behind me, and, lifting
me aff my feet, carried me shouther-high a' the way to my
bedroom; and, in spite o' my threats, expostulations, and
commands, locked me into it.</p>

<p>"Weel, thought I, as I threw myself down upon the bed,
without taking aff my claes, (partly because I found my
head wanted ballast to tak them aff,) I said unto mysel&mdash;'This
comes o' having a wise and headstrong wife, and bairns
o' her way o' bringing up. But if ever I marry again and
hae a family, I shall ken better how to act.'</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding all that I had undergone and witnessed,
in the space o' ten minutes, I fell fast asleep; and the first
thing that I awoke to recollect&mdash;that is, to be conscious o'&mdash;was
my daughter Janet rushing to my bedside, and crying&mdash;'Faither!
faither! my mother is a prisoner!&mdash;my poor
dear mother, and James Patrick also!&mdash;and I heard the
laird saying that they would baith be transported, as the
very least that could happen them for last night's work,
which I understand will be punished more severely than
even highway robbery!'</p>

<p>"I awoke like a man born to a consciousness o' horror,
and o' naething but horror. All that I had seen and heard
and encountered on the night before, was just as a dream
to me, but a dismal dream I trow.</p>

<p>"'Where is yer mother?' I gasped, 'or what is it that
ye are saying, hinny? and&mdash;where is James Patrick?'</p>

<p>"'Oh!' cried my darling daughter, 'before this time
they are baith in Dumfries jail, for pu'ing down and burning
the toll-yetts, and threatening the life o' the laird. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
everybody says it will gang particularly hard against my
mother and poor James; for, though every one was to blame,
they were what they ca' ringleaders.'</p>

<p>"I soon recollected enough o' the previous night's proceedings
to comprehend what my daughter said. I hurried
on my claes, and awa I flew to Dumfries. But I ought to
tell ye, that the laird's servants had ridden in every direction
for assistance; and having got three or four constables, and
about a dozen o' the regular military, all armed wi' swords
and pistols, they made poor Kirsty and James Patrick, wi'
about a dozen others, prisoners, and conveyed them to
Dumfries jail.</p>

<p>"When I was shewn into the prison, Kirsty and James,
and the whole o' them, were together. 'O Kirsty, woman!'
said I, in great distress, 'could ye no hae keepit at hame
while my back was turned! Why hae ye brought the like
o' this upon us? I'm sure ye kenned better! <i>Was the destruction
o' the machine and the stackyard no a warning to
ye!</i>'</p>

<p>"'William,' answered she, 'what is it that ye mean?&mdash;is
this a time to cast upon me yer low-minded suspicions?
Had ye last nicht acted as a man, we micht hae got the
laird to comply wi' our request; but it is through you, and
such as you, that everything in this unlucky country is
gaun to destruction; and sorry am I to say that ill o' ye&mdash;for
a kind, a good, and a faithfu' husband hae ye been to
me, William.'</p>

<p>"'O sir!' said James Patrick, coming forward and taking
me by the hand, 'may I just beg that ye will tak my
respects to yer dochter Janet; and, I hope, that whatever
may be the issue o' this awkward affair, that she will in no
way look down upon me, because I happen to be as a sort
o' prisoner in a jail.' My heart rose to my mouth, and I
hadna a word to say to either my wife or him.</p>

<p>"'Weel," said I, as I left them, 'I must do the best I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
can to bring baith o' ye aff; and, to accomplish it, the best
lawyers in a' Scotland shall be employed.'</p>

<p>"But to go on&mdash;at a very great expense, I, and the faither
o' James Patrick, had employed the very principal advocates
that went upon the Dumfries circuit; and they tauld us
that we had naething to fear, and that we might keep ourselves
quite at ease.</p>

<p>"I was glad that my son David hadna been seized and
imprisoned, as weel as his mother and James Patrick, for
he also had been ane o' the ringleaders in the breaking doun
and burning o' the toll-bars, and in the assault upon the
laird. But he escaped apprehension at the time, and I
suppose they thought that they had enough in custody to
answer the ends o' justice and the law, and, therefore, he
was permitted to remain unmolested.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, comes the most melancholy part o' my story.
I had a quantity o' wool to deliver to the Yorkshire buyer,
I hae already mentioned, upon a certain day. My son
David was to drive the carts wi' it to Annan. It was sair
wark, and he had but little sleep for a fortnight thegether.
It caused him to travel night and day, load after load. Now,
I needna tell ye, that at that period the roads were literally
bottomless. The horse just went plunge, plunging, and the
cart jerking, now to ae side, and now to another, or giein a
shake sufficient to drive the life out o' ony body that was
in it. Now, the one wheel was on a hill, and the other in
a hollow; or, again, baith were up to the axle-tree in mud,
or the horse half-swimming in water! And yet people cried
out against toll-bars! But, as I hae been telling ye, my
son David had driven wool to Annan for a fortnight, and
he was sair worn out. The roads were in a dreadful state&mdash;worse
than if, now-a-days, ye were to attempt to drive
through a bog.</p>

<p>"Ae night, when he was expected hame, his sister Janet,
and mysel' sat lang up waiting upon him, and wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
what could be keeping him, when a stranger rode up to the
door, and asked if 'one Mr William Wastle lived there?' I
replied 'Yes!' And, oh! what think ye were his tidings,
but that my name had been seen upon the carts, that the
horses had stuck fast in the roads, and that my son David,
who had fallen from the shafts, had either been killed, or
drowned among the horses' feet!</p>

<p>"I thought his brothers and sisters, and especially Janet,
would have gane oot o' their judgment. As for me, a' the
trials I had had were but as a drap in a bucket when compared
wi' this!</p>

<p>"But, after I had mourned for a night, the worst was
to come. Hoo was I to tell his poor imprisoned mother!&mdash;imprisoned
as she wis for opposing the very thing that
would hae saved her son's life!</p>

<p>"Next day I went to Dumfries; but I declare that I never
saw the light o' the sun hae sic a dismal appearance. The
fields appeared to me as if I saw them through a mist.
Even distance wasna as it used to be. I was admitted into
the prison, but I winna&mdash;oh no! I canna repeat to ye the
manner in which I communicated the tidings to his mother!
It was too much for her then&mdash;it would be the same for me
now! for naething in the whole coorse o' my life ever shook
me so much as the death o' my poor David. But I remember
o' saying to her, and I declare to you upon the word o'
a man, unthinkingly&mdash;'O Kirsty, woman! had we had toll-bars,
David might still hae been living!'</p>

<p>"'William, William!' she cried, and fell upon my neck,
'will ye kill me outright!' And, for the first time in my
life, I saw the tears gushing down her cheeks. Those tears
washed away the very remembrance o' the machine, and
the burning o' the stacks. I pressed her to my heart, and
my tears mingled wi' hers.</p>

<p>"I believe it was partly through our laird that baith
Kirsty and James Patrick were liberated without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
brought to a trial. Her imprisonment, and the death o' our
son, had wrought a great change upon my wife; and I
think it was hardly three months after her being set at
liberty, that we were baith sent for to auld John Neilson
the barnman's, whose wife Peggy lay upon her death-bed.
When we approached her bedside, she raised herself upon
her elbow, and said&mdash;'The burning o' yer barn and stackyard
has always been a mystery&mdash;hear the real truth from
the words o' a dying and guilty woman. Yer machine had
thrown my husband out o' employment, and when yer wife
there gied me back the pipe, a whuff o' which I said would
do her good, <i>I let the burning dottle drap among the straw</i>&mdash;nane
o' ye observed it&mdash;ye were a' leaving the barn. Now,
ye ken the cause&mdash;on my death-bed I make the confession.'</p>

<p>"I declare I thought my heart would hae louped out o'
my body. I pressed my wife, against whom I had harboured
such vile suspicions, to my breast. She saw my
meaning&mdash;she read my feelings.</p>

<p>"'William,' said she, kindly, 'if ye hae onything on yer
mind that ye wish to forget, so hae I; let us baith forget
and forgie!'</p>

<p>"I felt Kirsty's bosom heaving upon mine, and I was
happy.</p>

<p>"Within six months after this, James Patrick and our
dochter Janet were married; and an enviable couple they
then were, and such they are unto this day. And, as for
my Kirsty, auld though she is, and though the sang says&mdash;</p>

<p>
'I wadna gie a button for her,'<br />
</p>

<p>auld, I say, as she is, and wi' a' her faults, I would gie a'
the buttons upon my coat for her still, and a' the siller that
ever was in my pouch into the bargain."</p>

<h2>THE STONE-BREAKER.</h2>


<p>If any of our readers had had occasion to go out, for a
couple of miles or so, on the road leading from Edinburgh
to the village of Carlops, any time during the summer of
the year 1836, they would have seen a little old man&mdash;very
old&mdash;employed in breaking metal for the roads. The
exact spot where <i>we</i> saw him, was at the turn of the eastern
shoulder of the Pentland Hills; but the nature of his employment
rendering him somewhat migratory, he may have
been seen by others in a different locality. In the appearance
of the old stone-breaker, there was nothing particularly
interesting&mdash;nothing to attract the attention of the
passer-by&mdash;unless it might be his great age. This, however,
certainly was calculated to do so; and when it did, it
must have been accompanied by a painful feeling at seeing
one so old and feeble still toiling for the day that was passing
over him; and toiling, too, at one of the most dreary,
laborious, and miserable occupations which can well be conceived.
Had the old man no children who could provide
for the little wants of their aged parent, without the necessity
of his still labouring for them&mdash;who could secure him
in that ease which exhausted nature demanded? It appeared
not. Perhaps it was a spirit of independence that
nerved his weak arm, and kept him toiling so far beyond
the usual term of human capability. Probably the proud-spirited
old man would break no bread but that which he
had earned by the sweat of his brow and the labour of his
hands. Perhaps it was so. At any rate, this we know, that,
at the early hour of five in the morning, as regularly as the
morning came, the old stone-breaker had already commenced
his monotonous labour. But this was not all. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
also, by this early hour, walked upwards of four miles&mdash;for
so far distant was the scene of his occupation from the
place of his residence, Edinburgh. He must, therefore,
have left home between three and four o'clock, and this was
his daily round, without intermission, without variation,
and without relaxation. A bottle of butter-milk and a
penny loaf formed each day's sustenance. His daily earnings,
labouring from five in the morning till six at night,
averaged about ninepence! Hear ye this, ye who ride in
emblazoned carriages! Hear ye this, ye loungers on the
well-stuffed couch!&mdash;and hear it, ye revellers at the festive
board, who have never toiled for the luxuries ye enjoy!
Hear it, and think of it! But of this person we have other
things to tell; and to these we proceed.</p>

<p>One morning, just after he had commenced the labours of
the day, a young man, of about four or five and twenty
years of age, accosted him, wished him a good morning,
and seated himself on the heap of broken metal on which
the old man was at work, and did so seemingly with the
intention of entering into conversation with him. This was
a proceeding to which the latter was much accustomed, it
being a frequent practice with the humbler class of wayfarers.
The advances of the stranger, therefore, in the present
instance, did not for a moment interrupt his labours, or
slacken his assiduity. He hammered on without raising his
head, even while returning the greetings that were made him.</p>

<p>"A delightful view from this spot," said the young man,
breaking in upon a silence which had continued for some
time after the first salutations had passed between them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old man, drily; and, continuing his
operations, he again relapsed into his usual taciturnity; for,
in truth, he was naturally of a morose and uncommunicative
disposition. Undeterred by his cold, repulsive manner,
the stranger again broke silence, and said, with a deep-drawn
sigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"How I envy these little birds that hop so joyously from
spray to spray! Their life is a happy one. Would to God
I were one of them!"</p>

<p>The oddness of the expressions, and the earnestness with
which they were pronounced, had an effect on the labourer
which few things had. They induced him to pause in his
work, to raise his head, and to look in the face of the
speaker, which he did with a smile of undefinable meaning.
It was the first full look he had taken of him, and it
discovered to him a countenance open and pleasing in its
expression, but marked with deep melancholy, and telling,
in language not to be misunderstood, a tale of heart-sickness
of the most racking and depressing kind.</p>

<p>"Has your lot been ill cast, young man, that ye envy
the bits o' burds o' the air the freedom and the liberty that
God has gien them?" said the old man, eyeing the stranger
scrutinizingly, with a keen, penetrating grey eye, that had
not even yet lost all its fire.</p>

<p>"It has," replied the latter. "I have been unfortunate
in the world. I have struggled hard with my fate, but it
has at length overwhelmed me."</p>

<p>The old man muttered something unintelligibly, and,
without vouchsafing any other reply, resumed his labours.
After another pause of some duration, which, however, he
had evidently employed in <i>thinking</i> on the declaration of
unhappiness which had just been made him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some folly o' your ain, young man, very likely," said
he, carelessly, and still knapping the stones, whose bulk it
was his employment to reduce.</p>

<p>"No," replied the young man, blushing; but it was a
blush which he who caused it did not see. "I cannot
blame myself."</p>

<p>"Nae man does," interposed the stone-breaker; "he aye
blames his neighbours."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps so," rejoined the stranger; "but you will
allow that it is perfectly possible for a man to be unfortunate
without any fault on his own part."</p>

<p>"I hae seldom seen't," replied the ungracious and unaccommodating
old man; and he hammered on.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps so," said the youth; "but I hope you
will not deny that such things <i>may</i> be."</p>

<p>"Canna say," was the brief, but sufficiently discouraging
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Then let us drop the subject," said the stranger, smilingly.
"Each will still judge of the world by his own experience.
But, methinks, your own case, my friend, is a
hard enough one. To see a man of your years labouring at
this miserable employment, is a painful sight. Your debt
to fortune is also light, I should believe."</p>

<p>"I hae aye trusted mair to my ain industry than to fortune,
young man. I never pat it in her power to jilt me.
I never trusted her, and therefore, she has never deceived
me; so her and me are quits." And the old man plied
away with his long, light hammer.</p>

<p>"Yet your earnings must be scanty?"</p>

<p>"I dinna compleen o' them."</p>

<p>"I daresay not; but will you not take it amiss my offering
this small addition to them?" And he tendered him a
half-crown piece. "I have but little to spare, and that
must be my apology for offering you so trifling a gift."</p>

<p>The man here again paused in his operations, and again
looked full in the face of the stranger, but without making
any motion towards accepting the proffered donation.</p>

<p>"I thocht ye said ye war in straits, young man," he said,
and now resting his elbow on the end of his hammer.</p>

<p>"And I said truly," replied the former, again colouring.</p>

<p>"Then hoo come ye to be sportin yer siller sae freely?
I wad hae thocht ye wad hae as muckle need o' a half-croon
as I hae?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps I may," replied the stranger; "but that's not
to hinder me from feeling for others, nor from relieving
their distresses so far as I can."</p>

<p>"Foolish doctrine, young man, an' no' for this warl.
It's nae wunner that ye're in difficulties. I guessed the faut
was yer ain, and noo I'm sure o't. Put up yer half-croon,
sir. I dinna tak charity."</p>

<p>"I hope, however, I have not offended you by the offer?
It was well meant."</p>

<p>"Ou, I daresay&mdash;I'm no the least offended; but tak an
auld man's advice, an' dinna let yer feelins hae the command
o' yer purse-strings, otherwise ye'll never hae muckle
in't."</p>

<p>And the churlish old stone-breaker resumed his labours,
and again relapsed into taciturnity. Silent as he was, however,
it was evident that he was busily thinking, although
none but himself could possibly tell what was the subject
of his thoughts; but this soon discovered itself. After a
short time, he again spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>"What may the nature an' cause o' yer defeeculties be,
young man, an' I may speer?" he said&mdash;"and I fancy I
may, since ye hae been sae far free on the subject o yer ain
accord."</p>

<p>"That's soon told," replied the stranger. "Three years
ago, an aunt, with whom I was an especial favourite, left
me two hundred and fifty pounds. "With this sum I set
up in business in Edinburgh in the ironmongery line, to
which I was bred. My little trade prospered, and gradually
attained such an extent that I found I could not do
without an efficient assistant, who should look after the
shop while I was out on the necessary calls of business.
In this predicament I bethought me of my brother, who
was a year older than myself, and accordingly sent for him
to Selkirkshire, where he resided with our father, assisting
him in his small farming operations; this being the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of the latter. My brother came; and, for some time,
was everything I could have wished&mdash;sober, regular, and
attentive; and we thus got on swimmingly. This, however,
was a state of matters which was not long to continue.
When my brother had about completed a year with me, I
began to perceive a gradual falling off in his anxiety about
the interests of our little business. I remonstrated with
him on one or two occasions of palpable neglect; but this,
instead of inducing him to greater vigilance, had the effect
only of rendering him more and more careless. But I did
not then know the worst. I did not then know that, in
place of aiding, he was robbing me. This was the truth,
however. He had formed an infamous connection with a
woman of disreputable character, and the consequence was
the adoption of a regular system of plunder on my little
property, to answer the calls which she was constantly
making on my unfortunate relative.</p>

<p>"About this time I took ill, and, not suspecting the integrity
of my brother, although aware of his carelessness, I
did not hesitate to trust him with the entire conduct of my
affairs. Indeed, I could not help myself in this particular;
he best knowing my business, and being, besides, the natural
substitute for myself in such a case. For three months was
I confined, unable to leave my own room; and, when I did
come out, I found myself a ruined man. In this time, my
brother had appropriated almost every farthing that had
been drawn to his own purposes; and had, moreover, done
the same by some of my largest and best outstanding
accounts; and, to sum up all, he had fled, I knew not
whither, on the day previous to that on which I made my
first appearance in my shop after my recovery. That is
about ten days since."</p>

<p>"Did the rascal harry ye oot an' oot?" here interposed
the old stone-breaker, knapping away with great earnestness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; there was a little on which he could not lay his
hands&mdash;some considerable accounts which are payable only
yearly; there was also some stock in the shop; but these,
of course, are now the property of my creditors."</p>

<p>"But could ye no get a settlement wi' them, an' go on?"
inquired the other, still knapping away assiduously. "I'm
sure if you stated your case, your creditors wadna be owre
hard on ye."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they might not; but there is one circumstance
that puts it out of my power to make any attempt at arrangement.
There is one bill of fifty pounds, due to a Sheffield
house, on which diligence has been raised, and on which I
am threatened with instant incarceration. In truth, it is
this proceeding that has brought me here so early this morning.
I expected to have been taken in my bed, as the
charge was out yesterday, and I am here to keep out of the
way of the messengers. I am thus deprived of the power
of helping myself&mdash;of taking any steps towards the adjustment
of my affairs."</p>

<p>"An' could ye do any guid, think ye, if that debt wur
paid, or in some way arranged?" inquired the other.</p>

<p>"I think I could;" said the party questioned. "My good
outstanding debts are yet considerable, and so is the stock
in the shop; so that, had a little time been allowed me, I
could have got round. But all that is knocked on the head,
by the impending diligence against me. That settles the
matter at once, by depriving me of the necessary liberty to
go about my affairs."</p>

<p>"It's a pity," said the man, drily. "Wha's the man o'
business in Edinburgh that thae Sheffield folk hae employed
to prosecute ye? What ca' ye him?"</p>

<p>"Mr Langridge."</p>

<p>"Ou ay, I hae heard o' him. An will he no gie ye ony
indulgence?"</p>

<p>"He cannot. His instructions are imperative, otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
he would, I am convinced; for he is an excellent sort of
man, and knows all about me and my affairs. Indeed, so
willing was he to have assisted me, that, when the bill was
first put into his hands, he wrote to his clients, strongly
recommending lenient measures and bearing testimony, on
his own knowledge, to the hardship of my case; but their
reply was brief and peremptory. It was to proceed against
me instantly, and threatening him with the loss of their
business if he did not. For this uncompromising severity
they assigned as a reason, their having been lately 'taken
in,' as they expressed it, to a large extent, by a number
of their Scotch customers. So Mr. Langridge had no alternative
but to do his duty, and let matters take their course."</p>

<p>"True," replied the monosyllabic stone-breaker. It was
all he said, or, if he had intended to say more, which, however,
is not probable, no opportunity was afforded him;
for at this moment three labouring men of his acquaintance,
who were on their way to their work, came up and
began conversing. On this interruption taking place, the
young man rose, wished him a good morning, which was
merely replied to by a slight nod, and went his way.</p>

<p>At this point in our story, we change the scene to the
writing chambers of Mr. Langridge, and the time we advance
to the evening of the day on which our tale opens.</p>

<p>It will surprise the reader to find our old stone-breaker,
still wearing the patched and threadbare clothes, the battered
and torn hat, and the coarse, strong shoes, which had
never rejoiced in the contact of blacking brush, in which
he prosecuted his daily labours, ringing the door-bell of Mr
Langridge's house, about eight o'clock in the evening. It
will still more surprise him, perhaps, to find this man received,
notwithstanding the homeliness, we might have said
wretchedness, of his appearance, by Mr Langridge himself
with great courtesy, and even with a slight air of deference.</p>

<p>On his entering the apartment in which that gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
was, the latter immediately rose from his seat, and advanced,
with extended hand, towards him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr Lumsden," he exclaimed, "how do you do? I
hope I see you well. Come, my dear sir, take a chair."
And he ran with eager civility for the convenience he named,
and placed it for the accommodation of his visiter.</p>

<p>When the old man was seated&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, my dear sir," said Mr Langridge, "I am sorry to
say that <i>your rents</i> have not come so well in this last half-year
as usual. We are considerably short." And the man
of business hurried to a large green painted tin box, that
stood amongst some others on a shelf, and bore on its front
the name of Lumsden, and from this drew forth what appeared
to be a list or rent roll, which he spread out on the
table. "We are considerably short," he said. "There's
six or eight of your folks who have paid nothing yet, and
as many more who have made only partial payments."</p>

<p>"Ay," said the man, crustily, "what's the meanin' o
that? Ye maun just screw them up, Mr Langridge; for I
canna want my siller, and I winna want it. Hae thae folk
Thamsons, paid yet?"</p>

<p>"Not a shilling more than you know of," replied Mr
Langridge.</p>

<p>"Weel, then, Mr Langridge, ye maun just tak the necessary
steps to recover; for I'm determined to hae my rent.
I'm no gaun to aloo mysel' to be ruined this way. They
wadna leave me a sark to my back, if I wad let them. Ye
maun just sequestrate, Mr Langridge&mdash;ye maun just sequestrate,
an' we'll help oorsels to payment, since they winna
help us."</p>

<p>"Oh, surely, surely, my dear sir. All fair and right.
But I would just mention to you, that though, latterly,
they have been dilatory payers&mdash;I would say, shamefully
so&mdash;they are yet decent, honest, well-meaning people, these
Thomsons; and that, moreover, there is some reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
their having been so remiss of late, although it is, certainly,
none whatever why you should want your rent."</p>

<p>"No, I fancy no," here interposed the other, with a
triumphant chuckle.</p>

<p>"No, certainly not," went on Mr Langridge, who seemed
to know well how to manage his eccentric client; "but
only, I would just mention to you, that the <i>reason</i> of the
dilatoriness of the Thomsons, is the husband's having been
unable, from illness, to work for the last three months, and
that, in that time, they have also lost no less than two
children. It is rather a piteous case."</p>

<p>"An' what hae I to do wi' a' that?" exclaimed the
other, impatiently. "What hae I to do wi' a' that, I wad
like to ken? Am I to be ca'ed on to relieve a' the distress
in the world? That wad be a bonny set o't. Am I to be
robbed o' my richts that others may be at ease? That
I winna, I warrant you. See that ye recover me thae
folk's arrears, Mr Langridge, by hook or by crook, and that
immediately, though ye shouldna leave them a stool to sit
upon. That's <i>my</i> instructions to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"And they shall be obeyed, Mr Lumsden," replied the
man of business&mdash;"obeyed to the letter. I merely mentioned
the circumstance to you, in order that you might be
fully apprized of everything relating to your tenants, which
it is proper you should know."</p>

<p>"Weel, weel, but there's nae use in troublin' me wi'
thae stories. I dinna want to be plagued wi' folk makin'
puir mouths. There's aye a design on ane's pouch below't.
By the bye, Mr Langridge," continued he, after
a momentary pause, "hae ye a young chield o' an airnmonger
in your hauns enow about some bill or anither that
he canna pay."</p>

<p>"The name?" inquired Mr Langridge, musingly.</p>

<p>"Troth that I cannot tell you; for I never heard it, and
forgot to speer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me see&mdash;oh, ay&mdash;you will mean, I dare say, a
young man of the name of John Reid, poor fellow?"</p>

<p>"Very likely," said the client; "Is he a young man, an
airnmonger to business, and hae ye diligence against him
enow on a fifty pound bill, due to a Sheffield hoose?"</p>

<p>"The same," replied Mr Longridge. "These are exactly
the circumstances. How came you, Mr Lumsden," he
added, smilingly, "to be so well informed of them?"</p>

<p>"I'll maybe explain that afterwards; but, in the meantime,
will ye tell me what sort o' a lad this Mr Reid is?
Is he a decent, weel-doin' young man?"</p>

<p>"Remarkably so," replied Mr Langridge, "remarkably
so, Mr Lumsden. I can answer for that; for I have known
him now for a good while, and have had many opportunities
of estimating his character."</p>

<p>"Then hoo cam he into his present difficulties?"</p>

<p>"Through the misconduct of a brother&mdash;entirely through
the misconduct of a brother." And Mr Langridge proceeded
to give precisely the same account of the young
man's misfortunes, and of the present state of his affairs,
that he himself had given to the old stone-breaker, as
already detailed to the reader. When he had concluded&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems to me rather a hard sort o' case," said the
client. "But could you no help him a wee on the score o'
lenity?"</p>

<p>"I would willingly do it if I could; but it's not in my
power. My instructions are peremptory. I dare not do it
but with a certainty of losing the business of the pursuers,
the best clients I have."</p>

<p>"Naething, then, 'll do but payin' the siller, I suppose?"
said the other.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing, I fear. My clients seem quite determined.
They are enraged at some smart losses which
they have lately sustained in Scotland, and will give no
quarter."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I suppose if they <i>war</i> paid, they would be satisfied,"
said the stone-breaker.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Mr Lumsden, no doubt of <i>that</i>," exclaimed
Mr Langridge, laughing. "That would settle the business
at once."</p>

<p>"I fancy sae," said the other, musingly. Then, after a
pause&mdash;"An' think ye the lad wad get on if this stane were
taen frae aboot his neck?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it&mdash;not the least," replied Mr Langridge,
"for I have every confidence in the young man's
industry and uprightness of principle. But he has no
friend to back him, poor fellow: no one to help him out
of the scrape."</p>

<p>"Ye canna be quite sure o' that, Mr Langridge," said the
old man. "What if I hae taen a fancy to help him mysel?"</p>

<p>"You, Mr Lumsden!&mdash;you!" exclaimed Mr Langridge
in great surprise. "What motive on earth can you have
for assisting him?"</p>

<p>"I didna say that I meant to assist him&mdash;I only asked
ye, what if I took a fancy to do't?"</p>

<p>"Why, to that I can only say that, if you have, he is all
right, and will get his head above water yet. But you
surprise me, Mr Lumsden, by this interest in Reid. May
I ask how it comes about?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you a' that presently, but I'll first tell you that
I <i>do</i> mean to assist the young man in his straits. I'll advance
the money to pay that bill for him. Will ye see to
that, then, Mr Langridge? Put me doon for the amount oot
o' the funds in your hauns, and stay further proceedins."</p>

<p>Mr Langridge could not express the surprise he felt on
this extraordinary intimation from a man who, although
there were some good points in his character, notwithstanding
of the outward crust of churlishness in which it
was encased, he never believed capable of any very striking
act of generosity. Mr Langridge, we say, could not express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the surprise which this unlooked-for instance of that quality
in Mr Lumsden inspired, nor did he attempt it;
for he justly considered that such expression would be
offensive to the old man, as implying a belief that he had
been deemed incapable of doing a benevolent thing. Mr
Langridge, therefore, kept his feelings, on the occasion, to
himself, and contented himself with promising compliance,
and venturing a muttered compliment or two, which, however,
were ungraciously enough received, on the old man's
generosity.</p>

<p>"But whar's the young man to be fand?" inquired the
latter.</p>

<p>"Why, that I cannot well tell you," replied Mr Langridge;
"for I was informed, in the course of the day, by
the messengers whom I employed to apprehend him, that
he had left his lodging early in the morning, no doubt in
order to avoid them, and they could not ascertain where he
had gone to."</p>

<p>"Humph, that's awkward," replied the client. "I wad
like to find him."</p>

<p>"I fear that will be difficult," replied Mr Langridge;
"but I will call off the bloodhounds in the meantime, and
terminate proceedings."</p>

<p>"Ay, do sae, do sae. But can we no get haud o' the lad
ony way?"</p>

<p>At this moment, a rap at the door of the apartment in
which was Mr Langridge and his client, interrupted further
conversation on the subject.</p>

<p>"Come in," exclaimed the former.</p>

<p>The door opened, and in walked two messengers, with
Reid a prisoner between them. We leave it to the reader
to conceive the latter's surprise, on beholding his acquaintance
of the morning, the old stone-breaker, seated in an
arm-chair in Mr Langridge's writing-chamber. But while
he looked this surprise, he also seemed to feel acutely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
humiliation of his position. After a nod of recognition, he
said, with an attempt at a smile, and addressing himself to
the old man&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see they have got me after all, my friend. But it
was my own doing. On reflection, I saw no use in endeavouring
to avoid them, and gave myself up, at least, threw
myself in their way, in order to encounter the worst at once,
and be done with it."</p>

<p>"I daresay ye was richt, after a'," replied the stone-breaker;
"it was the best way. Mr Langridge," he added,
and now rising from his seat, "wad ye speak wi' me for a
minnit, in another room?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr Lumsden," replied Mr Langridge.</p>

<p>"Will we proceed with the prisoner?" inquired one of
the messengers.</p>

<p>"No, remain where you are a moment, till I return;"
and Mr Langridge led the way out of the apartment, followed
by the old stone-breaker. When they had reached
another room, and the door had been secured&mdash;</p>

<p>"Noo, Mr Langridge, anent what I was speaking to ye
about regarding this young man wha has come in sae curiously
upon us, juist whan we were wanting him&mdash;I dinna
care to be seen in the matter, sae ye maun juist manag't for
me yersel."</p>

<p>"Had ye no better enjoy the satisfaction of your own
good deed in person, Mr Lumsden, by telling Mr Reid of
the important service you intend doing him?"</p>

<p>"I'll do naething o' the kind," replied the old stone-breaker,
testily. "I dinna want to be bothered wi't. Sae
juist pay ye his bill and charges, Mr Langridge, an' keep an
e'e on his proceedins afterwards, an' let me ken frae time to
time hoo he's gettin on."</p>

<p>With these instructions Mr Langridge promised compliance;
and, on his having done so, the stone-breaker proposed
to depart; but, just as he was about doing so, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
turned suddenly round to his man of business, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"About the Tamsons, Mr Langridge, ye needna, for a
wee while, tak thae staps again them that I was speakin
aboot. Let them alane a wee till they get roun a bit."</p>

<p>"I'll do so, Mr Lumsden," replied the worthy writer,
who, the reader will observe, had accomplished his generous
purpose dexterously. He knew his man, and acted
accordingly.</p>

<p>"What's their arrears, again?" inquired the other.</p>

<p>"Half-a-year's rent&mdash;3, 17s.," replied Mr Langridge.</p>

<p>"Ay, it's a heap o' siller&mdash;no to be fan at every dyke
side. An' then, there's this half-year rinning on, an' very
near due. That'll mak&mdash;hoo much?"</p>

<p>"Just 7, 14s. exactly, Mr Lumsden."</p>

<p>"Ay, exactly," replied the latter, who had been making
a mental calculation of the amount, and had arrived, although
more slowly than his experienced lawyer, at the
same result. "A serious soom," added the client.</p>

<p>"No trifle, indeed, Mr Lumsden," said Mr Langridge;
"but it's safe enough. They're honest people."</p>

<p>"Ye'r aye harpin on that string," replied the stone-breaker,
surlily; "but what signifies their honesty to me, if
they'll no pay me my rent?"</p>

<p>"True, very true," said the law agent. "That's the only
practical honesty."</p>

<p>"See you an' get thae arrears, at ony rate, oot o' them,
<i>if</i> ye can, Mr Langridge; an', if ye canna, I suppose we
maun juist want them. Ye needna push owre hard for
them either, since they're in the state ye say. But ye'll
surely mak the present half-year oot o' them. That maun
be paid. Mind <i>that</i>, at ony rate, maun be paid, Mr Langridge."
And saying this, he placed his old tattered hat,
which he had hitherto held in his hand, on his head, and
left the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>On his departure, Mr Langridge hastily entered the apartment
in which, he had left the messengers with their prisoner.</p>

<p>"We're just waiting marching orders, Mr Langridge,"
said the latter, on his entering, and making an attempt at
playfulness, with which his spirit but ill accorded. "My
friends here are getting tired of their charge, and anxious to
be relieved of him."</p>

<p>"Are they so, Mr Reid?" replied Mr Langridge, smiling.</p>

<p>"Why, then, we had best relieve them at once." Then
turning to the principal officer&mdash;"Quit your prisoner, Maxwell&mdash;the
debt is settled. Mr Reid, you are at liberty."</p>

<p>The blood rushed to poor Reid's face, and then withdrew,
leaving it as pale as death, and yet he could express no
part of the feelings which caused these violent alternations.
At length&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr Langridge," he said, "what is the meaning of this?
How do I come to be liberated?"</p>

<p>"By the simplest and most effectual of all processes, Mr
Reid," replied the worthy writer, smiling; "by the payment
of the debt."</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> have not paid the debt, Mr Langridge. I <i>could</i>
not pay the debt."</p>

<p>"No; but somebody else might. The short and the long
of it is, Mr Reid, that a <i>friend</i> has come forward, and settled
the claim on which diligence was raised against you. The
bill, with interest and all expenses, <i>is</i> paid, and you are
again a free man."</p>

<p>Again overwhelmed by his feelings, which were a thousand
times more eloquently expressed by a flood of silent
tears than they could have been by the most carefully
rounded periods, it was some time before the young man
could pursue the conversation, or ask for the further information
which he yet intensely longed to possess. On recovering
from the burst of emotion which had, for the
moment, deprived him of the power of utterance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"And <i>who</i>, pray, Mr Langridge, is this friend&mdash;this
friend indeed?</p>

<p>"Why, I do not know exactly whether I am at liberty
to tell you, Mr Reid," replied Mr Langridge. "The friend
you allude to declined transacting this matter personally
with you, which seems to imply that he did not care that
you should know who he was; yet, as he certainly did not
expressly forbid me to disclose him, and as I think it but
right that you should know to whom you are indebted, I
will venture to tell you. Had you some conversation, at an
early hour this morning, with an old stone-breaker, on the
highway side, about three or four miles from town?"</p>

<p>"I had. The old man that was sitting here when I
came in."</p>

<p>"The same. Well, what would you think if <i>he</i> should
have been the friend in question? Would you expect from
his manner, that he <i>would</i> do such a thing? or, from his
appearance and occupation, that he could?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not&mdash;certainly not. The old man&mdash;the poor
old man, to whom I offered half-a-crown&mdash;who works for
ninepence a-day&mdash;who never saw me in his life before this
morning&mdash;who knows nothing of me! Impossible, Mr
Langridge&mdash;impossible; he cannot be the man. You do
not say that he is?"</p>

<p>"But I do though, Mr Reid, and that most distinctly.
It is he, and no other, I assure you, who has done you this
friendly service."</p>

<p>"Then, if it be so, I know not what to say to it, Mr
Langridge. I can say nothing. I trust, however, I shall
not be found wanting on the score of gratitude. I can say
no more. But will you be so good as inform me, if you
can, how the good man has come to do me so friendly a
service? Who on earth, or what is he?"</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down, Mr Reid, and I'll answer all your
questions&mdash;I'll tell you all about him," replied Mr Langridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Reid having complied with this invitation, the latter
began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The history of the old stone-breaker, my good sir, is a
very short and a very simple one. It contains no vicissitude,
and to few, besides ourselves, would be found possessing
any particular interest. Your friend was, in his youth,
a soldier, and served, I believe, in the American war. At
his return home on the conclusion of that war, he was discharged,
still a young man, and shortly after married a
woman with a fortune" (smilingly) "of some five-and-twenty
or thirty pounds. With this sum the thrifty pair purchased
two or three cows, and commenced the business of cowfeeders.
They prospered; for they were both saving and
industrious, and, in time, realized a considerable sum of
money, which they went on increasing. This they invested
in house property from time to time, till their possessions of
this kind became very valuable.</p>

<p>"For upwards of forty years they continued in this way,
when Mrs Lumsden died, leaving her husband a lonely
widower; for they had no children. On the death of the
former, the latter, who was now an old man, and unequal to
conducting, alone, the business in which his wife's activity
and industry had hitherto aided him, sold off his cows, and
proposed to live in retirement on the rents of his property;
and this he did for some time. Accustomed, however, to a
life of constant labour and exertion, the old man soon found
the idleness on which he had thrown himself, intolerably
irksome. He became miserable from a mere want of having
something to do. While in this state of ennui, chancing
one day to stroll into the country, (this is what he told
me himself,) he saw some labouring men knapping stones
by the way-side; and strange as the fancy may seem, he
was instantly struck with a desire of taking to this occupation.
He did so, and has, from that day to the present,
now upwards of ten years, pursued it with as much assiduity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
as if it was his only resource for a subsistence. He
has, as I already told you, no family of his own; neither has
he, I believe, any relation living; or, if there be, they must
be very remote; and, as he strictly confines his expenditure
to his daily earnings as a stone-breaker&mdash;some ninepence
a-day, I believe&mdash;his wealth is rapidly increasing, and is, at
this moment, no trifle, I assure you. Now, my good sir, when
I tell you that I am the law agent of this strange, eccentric
person, and that I manage all his business for him, I have told
you everything about him that is worth mentioning."</p>

<p>"There is just one thing, Mr Langridge," said Mr Reid,
who had been an attentive listener to the tale just told
him, "that wants explanation: can you give me the smallest
shadow of a reason for the part he has acted towards me?"</p>

<p>"Nay, there you puzzle me; I cannot. It appears as
unaccountable to me as to you, although I have known Mr
Lumsden now for upwards of fifteen years."</p>

<p>"Did you ever know him do a thing of this kind before?"</p>

<p>"Never! and I must say candidly, that, although he is
by no means deficient in kindness of heart, notwithstanding
his rough exterior, I did not believe him capable of such an
act of generosity."</p>

<p>"It is an extraordinary matter," said Mr Reid; "and
although I can have but little right to inquire into the
<i>motives</i> for an act by which I am so largely benefited&mdash;it
seems ungracious to do so&mdash;yet would I give a good round
sum, if I had it to spare, to know the real cause of this
good man's friendship towards me."</p>

<p>"Why, that I suspect neither you nor I shall ever know.
I question much, indeed, if the principal actor in this affair
himself could give a reason for what he has done. It seems
to me just one of those odd and unaccountable things which
eccentric men, like Mr Lumsden, will sometimes do; and
with this solution of the mystery, and the benefit it has produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to you, I rather think, Mr Reid, you must be content.
I would, however, add, in order to redeem Mr Lumsden's
act of generosity from the character of a mere whim,
that your case was one eminently calculated to excite any
latent feeling of benevolence which he might possess; and
that your manner and appearance&mdash;no flattery&mdash;are equally
well calculated to second a claim so established. Yourself,
and your peculiar circumstances, in short, had chanced to
touch the right chord in a right man's breast, and hence
the response on which we are speculating."</p>

<p>Having thus discussed the knotty point of the old stonebreaker's
sudden act of generosity, Mr Langridge invited
Mr Reid to put his affairs into his hands, promising that
they should have the advantage, on his part, of something
more than mere professional zeal. This friendly invitation
the latter gladly accepted, and shortly after consigned all
his business matters to the care of the worthy writer, who
exerted himself in behalf of his client with an efficiency
that soon placed the latter once more in the way of well-doing.
And well he did; having subsequently realised a
very handsome independency. In the success of the young
man, no one rejoiced more than the old stone-breaker, who
frequently visited him in his shop; sometimes merely for
the purpose of seeing him; at others, to purchase some of
those little articles of ironmongery which the due preservation
of his dwelling-house property demanded. Let us state, too,
that, amongst his purchases, were, at different times, the hammer-heads
which he used in his occupation of stone-breaking.</p>

<p>In their first transaction in this way, there was something
curiously characteristic of the old man's peculiarities
of temper. Mr Reid, not yet perfectly aware of these
peculiarities, declined, for some time, putting any price on
a couple of hammer-heads which his friend had picked out.
He would have made him a present of them; and, to the
latter's inquiry as to their price, replied, evasively, and laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
while he spoke, that he would tell him that afterwards.</p>

<p>"I tak nae credit, young man," said the stone-breaker,
crustily, "tell me enow their cost." And he pulled out a
small greasy leathern purse, and was undoing its strings,
when Mr Reid laid his hand on his arm to prevent him,
at the same time telling him that he would do him a favour
by accepting the hammer-heads in a present. "What is
such a trifle between you and me, Mr Lumsden&mdash;you to
whom I owe everything?"</p>

<p>"You owe me a great deal mair than ye're ever likely
to pay me, at ony rate, young man, if this be the way ye
transact business," replied the other, with evident signs
of displeasure. "Tell me the price o' thae hammer-heads at
ance, an' be dune wi't. I hae nae broo o' folk that fling
awa their guids as ye seem inclined to do."</p>

<p>Mr Reid blushed at the reproof, but, seeing at once how
the land lay, with regard to his customer's temper, he now
plumply named the price of the hammers, sevenpence each.</p>

<p>"Sevenpence!" exclaimed the old man. "I'll gie ye
nae such price. Doonricht robbery! I can get them as
guid in ony shop in the toon for saxpence ha'penny. If
ye like to tak that price for them, ye may hae't. If no, ye
can keep them."</p>

<p>Mr Reid, now knowing his man somewhat better than
he did at first, demurred, but at length agreed to the abatement,
and the transaction was thus brought to a close.</p>

<p>We need hardly add, that the 50 advanced by the old
man to Mr Reid were subsequently repaid; but the call is
more imperative on us to state, that, on the former's death,
which took place about two years after, the latter found
himself named in his will for a very considerable sum. One,
somewhat larger, was bequeathed by the same document to
Mr Langridge. The remainder was appropriated to various
charities. And here, good reader, ends the story of the
Stone-Breaker.</p>

<h2>LAIRD RORIESON'S WILL.</h2>


<p>In the little town of Maybole there lived, some fifty years
ago or more, an old man of the name of George Rorieson,
more commonly called Laird Rorieson. He had been a
kind of general merchant, or trafficker in any kind of commodities
which he thought would yield him a profit; and,
by dint of great sagacity, had made some very fortunate
hits, and realised a large sum of money. Having begun the
world with a penny, he was emphatically the maker of his
own fortunes&mdash;a circumstance he was very proud of, and
loved to sound in the ears of certain individuals who envied
him his riches. Having amassed his money by an accumulation
of small sums, for a long course of years, he had
gradually become narrower and narrower, as his wealth
increased; and, by the time he arrived at the age of sixty,
his penurious feelings had become so strong and deeprooted
that he could scarcely afford himself the means of a
comfortable subsistence.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to say that Laird Rorieson never had
courage or liberality of sentiment sufficient to give him an
impulse towards matrimony; and truly it was alleged that he
never oven looked on womankind with any feelings different
from those with which he contemplated his fellow-creatures
generally; and these had always some connection, one way
or another, with making profit of them. But, though he
had no wife, he had a good store of nephews and nieces&mdash;somewhere
about twenty&mdash;all poor enough, God knows!
but all as hopeful as brides and bridegrooms of a great store
of wealth and bliss being awaiting them on the death of
Uncle Geordie.</p>

<p>The affection which these twenty nephews and nieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
shewed to Uncle George was remarkable; but, somehow
or another, the good uncle hated them mortally, and, the
bitterer he became, the more loving they waxed&mdash;so that
it was very wonderful to see so much human love and
sympathy thrown away upon an old churl who could
have seen all the devoted creatures at the devil.</p>

<p>It was indeed alleged that this crabbed miser had no
love for any one, all his affection being expended upon
his money-bags: but we are bound to say that this is not
quite the truth; for there was a neighbour of the name of
Saunders Gibbieson, a bachelor, for whom the Laird really
felt some small twinges of human kindness. Saunders
Gibbieson was as true a Scotchman as ever threw the
pawkie glamour of a twinkling grey eye over the open
face of an English victim. He was, as already said, a
bachelor; but unlike his friend Geordie, he loved the fair
sex, and vowed he would marry the bonniest lass o' Maybole
the moment he was able to sustain her "in bed, board,
and washing." He had scraped together a few pounds, maybe
to the extent of a hundred or two, and looked forward to
making himself happy at no very distant period. He was a
famous hand at a political argument; and there was not a
man in Maybole who could touch him at driving a bargain.</p>

<p>As already said, Geordie had a kind of feeling towards
Saunders, and there can be no doubt that Saunders had as
strong an affection for the "auld rich grub," as he called
him in his throat, as ever had any of the twenty nephews
and nieces already alluded to. In the evenings he often
went in and sat with him; and, by dint of curious jokes,
"humorous lees," and political anecdotes, he contrived to
wile, for a few minutes, the creature's heart from his
money-bags, and unbend his puckered cheeks and lips into
a species of compromise between a laugh and a grin.
It was no wonder, then, that Geordie had a kind of liking
for Saunders&mdash;seeing he got value in amusement from him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
without so much cost as even a piece of old dry cheese, of
a waught of thin ale. On the other hand, it was difficult
to see how Saunders could love the laird; and, indeed, it
was a matter of gossip what could induce a man so much
in request as Saunders Gibbieson to take so much pains in
pouring into the "leather lugs" of an old miser the precious
jokes that would have set the biggest table in Maybole
in a roar.</p>

<p>Now the time came when Laird Rorieson began to feel
the first touches of that big black angel who loves to hug
so fondly the sons of men. He was ill&mdash;he was indeed
very ill&mdash;and it would have done any man's heart good to
see the kindness and sympathy which his twenty nephews
and nieces paid him. Every hour one or other of them
was calling at his house; and his ears were regaled by the
sympathetic tones which their love for their dear uncle
wrung from their tender hearts. Oh, it was beautiful to
behold! Such things do credit to our fallen nature. But
the old grub loved it not; and it was even said he cursed
and swore in the very faces of the kind creatures, just as if
they had had an eye on the heavy coffers of gold that lay in
his house. This kindness on the part of his nephews and
nieces was thus converted into a kind of poison; for every
time they called, their uncle got into such a passion that
his remaining strength was well-nigh worn out. But he
had still enough left to sign his name; and the ungrateful
creature resolved upon leaving all his gold to found an hospital.
He sent for a man of the law, and had a consultation
with locked doors, and all things seemed in a fair way
for the poor nephews and nieces being sacrificed for ever.</p>

<p>This circumstance came to the ears of Saunders Gibbieson,
who had not been an unattentive spectator of the extraordinary
proceedings going on in the house of his neighbour.
As soon as he heard the news, he retired and meditated,
and communed with himself three hours on matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of deep concernment to him and the generations that might
descend from him. The result of all this study was a resolution
alike remarkable for its eccentricity and sagacity;
but Saunders' spirit dipped generally so deep in the wells of
wisdom that there was no wonder it should come forth
drunk, as it were, with the golden policy of cunning.</p>

<p>Now, all of a sudden, Saunders grew (as he said) very
ill&mdash;as ill indeed, or nearly as ill, as Laird Rorieson himself,
but, so full was he of brotherly love towards his neighbour,
that his sudden illness did not prevent him calling upon the
latter one night, when there seemed to be no great chance
of their being disturbed by any of the sympathetic nephews
and nieces. He found Geordie very weakly, and sat down
by the bedside, to pour the balm of his friendship and consolation
into the sick man's ear. The Laird received him
kindly, and as was his custom, Saunders got him into a
pleasant humour, by telling him something of a curious
nature that had occurred, or had been supposed by Saunders
to have occurred, during the day. He then began the more
important part of his work.</p>

<p>"You are ill, Laird," said he; "but I question muckle
if ye're sae ill as I am myself. For a long time I've been
in a dwinin way, and, though I hae kept up a fair appearance
and good spirits, I've been gradually getting thinner
and weaker. I fear I'm in a fair way for anither warld."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear't," replied the Laird. "It's a sad
thing to dee." And he shook as he uttered the word.</p>

<p>"Ay, an' it's a sad thing," said Saunders, "to be tormented
in your illness, wi' thae cursed corbies o' puir relations.
The moment I began to complain I've been tormented
wi' a host o' nephews and nieces, wha come and stare
into my hollow een, as if they would count the draps o' blude
that are yet left in my heart."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, are you in that plight too, Saunders?" groaned
the Laird. "The ravens have been croaking owre me for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
twa lang years. They come and perch on the very bedposts,
they croak, they whet their nebs, they look into my
face, and peer into my very heart. It's dreadful&mdash;and
there's nae remedy. I've tried to terrify them awa; but
they come aye back again. They've worn me fairly out."</p>

<p>"I've had many a meditation on the subject, Laird," said
Saunders; "and, between you and me, if there's a goose
quill in a' Scotland, I'll hae a shot at them. I haena
muckle i' the warld&mdash;a thousand or twa maybe, hard won,
Geordie, as a' gowd is in thae hard times; but the deil a
plack o't they'll ever touch."</p>

<p>"Ye'll be to found an hospital?" said the Laird.</p>

<p>"Na, na," answered Saunders. "I'll found nae beggar's
palace. I've studied political economy owre lang to be
ignorant o' the bad effects o' public charities. They relax
the sinews o' industry, and mak learned mendicants. Besides,
wha thanks the founder o' an hospital for his charity?
Nane!&mdash;nane! A puff or twa in the newspapers about
Gibbieson's mortification would be the hail upshot o' my
reward; and sensible folk would set me doun as an auld
curmudgeon, wha hadna heart to love and benefit a friend."</p>

<p>"There's some truth in that," muttered the Laird. "It's
a pity a body canna tak his gear wi' him. Sair hae I
toiled for it, and, oh! it's miserable! cruel! cruel! that I
should be obliged to leav't to a thankless warld! But
what are ye to do wi'fc, Saivjders?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I'm just to leave it a' to you, Laird," said
Saunders. "I have lang liked ye wi' a' the luve o' honest,
leal friendship; and, after muckle meditation, I canna fix
on a mortal creature wha is mair deservin o't than you,
my guid auld freend. You have a fair chance o' recovering;
I have nane. Ye may enjoy my gear lang after the
turf has grown thegither owre my grave; and God bless
the gift!"</p>

<p>"Kind, guid man!" cried the Laird, in a voice evincing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
strong emotion, either of love or greed. "That <i>is</i> kindness&mdash;ay,
very different frae the friendship o' my sisters' and
brothers' bairns. After a', I believe yer richt, Saunders&mdash;an
hospital has nae gratitude; and what have we to do wi'
a cauld and heartless warld?"</p>

<p>"There's just ae difficulty I hae," said Saunders. "The
will's written and signed; but I dinna weel ken whar to
lay it; for, when I'm dead, thae deevils o' corbies may smell
the bit paper and put it in the fire. Maybe you would tak
the charge o't for me, Laird."</p>

<p>"Ou ay," answered the Laird. "I'll keep it. The deil
o' are o' them will get it oot o' my clutches."</p>

<p>"Weel, weel, my dear friend," said Saunders. "I'll put
it into a tin box; the key ye'll find, after my breath's out,
in the little cupboard that's at the foot o' my bed&mdash;ye ken
the place. They can mak naething o' the key without the
box; and, if you canna find the key, you can force the box
open. Oh, I would like to see you reading the will in the
midst o' the harpies."</p>

<p>"That's weel arranged, Saunders; ye can set about it as
soon as you like."</p>

<p>"I intend to do it instantly, Laird," replied the man.
"I'll about it this moment." And he rose and went out of
the house.</p>

<p>In a short time, Saunders returned, holding in his hand
a small tin box. He laid it down upon the table, and, taking
out a small key, opened it, and took out a paper, entitled&mdash;"Last
Will and Testament."</p>

<p>"There it is, my good friend," he said; and, replacing the
paper in the box, he locked it and placed it in an escritoire
pointed out by the Laird. He then went away.</p>

<p>Next day, the lawyer came to carry into effect the
charitable resolution of Laird Rorieson; but he found that
a great change had taken place upon the old man's sentiments.
He was now adverse to a mortification, and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
he was resolved upon leaving his fortune to one whom he
considered to be a <i>real friend</i>, and, indeed, the only real
friend he had upon earth. The lawyer was surprised when
he ascertained that this friend was Saunders Gibbieson; but
it was not his province to object&mdash;so he departed straightway
to carry into effect the new resolution of the testator.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, the Laird sent a message to Saunders
to come and speak with him. Saunders obeyed; walking
in to him slowly, and apparently with great effort, as if he
had been labouring under a strong disease.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking again and again, Saunders," said
the Laird, "o' yer great kindness. You are the first man
that ever left me a farthing. The warld has rugged aff me
since ever I had a feather to pick. Nane has ever offered
me either a bite or a sup. You are the only friend I've
ever met upon earth."</p>

<p>"I hae only obeyed the dictates o' my heart," replied
Saunders; "and I am glad I have dune it, for I feel mysel
very weakly, and fear the clock o' this world's time will be
wound up wi' me in a very short period."</p>

<p>"Maybe no so sune as ye think, Saunders," replied the
Laird. "But my purpose is executed. Saunders, you are
my heir. Hand me that box there."</p>

<p>Saunders took up a small mahogany box that lay on the
table, and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"Here," continued the Laird, taking out a paper; "here
is my will. It's a' in your favour, Saunders&mdash;lands, houses,
guids, and chattels, heritable and moveable. Say naething;
you are my heir. Ha! ha! let the corbies croak. You've
dune me a guid service; I winna be ahint ye. Tak the
box into yer ain keeping. I'll keep the key. Awa wi't
this instant. Ha! ha! let the corbies croak."</p>

<p>Saunders obeyed. He carried the box into his own
house, placed it in his cupboard, locked the door, and put
the key into his pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>In about a month afterwards, old Laird Rorieson departed
this life. On the day of his death, his nephews
and nieces were in great commotion, and there was a
terrible running to and fro, and much whispering, and
wondering, and gossiping&mdash;all on the great subject of the
death of Uncle Geordie. On the day of his funeral, they
were all collected, to see whether there was any will. They,
of course, wished that there should be none, because they,
being his heirs, would succeed to all, if there was no disposition
of the old man's effects. By some means, Saunders
Gibbieson contrived to be present along with the expectants.
Perhaps he was allowed to be among them in the character
of a witness; but indeed, so certain were the nephews and
nieces of having succeeded in their efforts to please the dear
old man, that they could afford to allow the presence of any
number of witnesses who could vouch for the sacred gravity
of their countenances, and the deep sorrows of their bereaved
hearts. Nor was Saunders less under the affection
of lugubriousness himself; so that it was altogether one of
those beautiful sights so often witnessed on such melancholy
occasions, where every indication of selfishness is banished,
and nothing can be observed save that Christian solemnity
which proveth that "the devil hath been cast out of the
heart of man, even when he did appear to be strong." The
nephews and the nieces looked at Saunders, and Saunders
looked at them, and so solemn were these looks, that though
the writer was searching about for a will, no one seemed to
care whether he found one or not. It has been said that
"the heart of man is deceitful above all things;" but of
a surety the adage could not have been spoken there,
except with the determination to get it disproved for once
in the world, and the blessed object of shewing to us sons of
the seed of Abraham that we are not so wicked as we are
called.</p>

<p>At length the ominous little box was laid hold of and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
broken open, amidst a pretty nonchalance, and lo! there was
indeed a paper, bearing the fearful word "Will," and the
faces of the heirs turned as pale as the paper itself. It was
opened; but it was a fair, clean sheet of paper, and not a
drop of ink had stained its purity. "All safe, all safe,"
muttered the heirs.</p>

<p>"Here is another box," said Saunders Gibbieson, holding
up the mahogany one; "let us try it." And he opened
it, and took out Geordie's will. The writer read it aloud.
Saunders was sole heir to all the old miser's possessions,
amounting to 10,000. No one could tell the reason why
there were two papers marked "Will," and one of them a
blank sheet; and Saunders, simple man, did not trouble
himself to give any explanation.</p>

respecting Willie's wife:&mdash;viz., that "He was a farmer, who lived near Burns, at
Ellisland. She was a very singular woman&mdash;tea, she said, would be the ruin of
the nation; sugar was a sore evil; wheaten bread was only fit for babes; earthenware
was a pickpocket; wooden floors were but fit for thrashing upon; slated
roofs, cold; feathers good enough for fowls. In short, she abhorred change: and
whenever anything new appeared&mdash;such as harrows with iron teeth&mdash;'Ay! ay!'
she would exclaim, 'ye'll see the upshot!' Of all modern things she disliked
china most&mdash;she called it 'burnt clay,' and said 'it was only fit for haudin' the
broo o' stinkin' weeds,' as she called tea. On one occasion, an English dealer in
cups and saucers asked so much for his wares, that he exasperated a peasant, who
said, 'I canna purchase, but I ken ane that will. Gang there,' said he, pointing
to the house of Willie's wife, 'dinna be blate or burd-moothed; ask a guid penny&mdash;she
has the siller!' Away went the poor dealer, spread out his wares before
her, and summed up all by asking a double price. A blow from her crummock
was his instant reward, which not only fell on his person, but damaged his china.
'I'll learn ye,' quoth she, as she heard the saucers jingle, 'to come wi' yer
brazent English face, and yer bits o' burnt clay to me!' She was an unlovely
dame&mdash;her daughters, however, were beautiful."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
